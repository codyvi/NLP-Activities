I m looking into long term solutions but right now I just need short term Any advice on just not feeling sad ,0
Chronic Depression I m at this nihilistic point in a way I m not necessarily apathetic though I just don t feel like I m genuinely interested in living I understand the good and bad those clinical dead patients you hear about how that was the greatest moment clich I want that experience so much My relationship isn t great and I can t even begin to describe what s exactly onmy plate This is kind of how I feel in a point blank sense It s a waste of time to talk to a professional because it s just advice what they could tell me or what anyone could tell me is kind like yeah I know I can feel or understand that advice but I STILL feel this way Nobody on this website can take the amount of time to get emotionally connected I m too much in my head irl to express everything to a counselor I m a pacing quiet numb human I m scared lonely and afraid But eerily at ease and maybe that s the most alarming part Being okay or comfortable in that depressive state ,0
I just don t feel like doing anything anymore let it be playing with my animals three dogs and two cats going outside assisting my dad with work hanging out with friends or anything really I m already a mess I stay up all night just laying in bed I stopped doing the things I love and just stopped caring about everything People always say the same thing Get a therapist or it ll be better soon I know they re lying though I ve been like this for about five years now Heh my dad always says that he gets it However he doesn t He doesn t feel like he is constantly drowning in sorrow I can t get a therapist cause then I ll have to use my parent s money and then they ll find out how I am and I don t want that I don t want their pity x200B Sorry for the rant and waste of time for those who read this ,0
I was on lonely as I was feeling that way I come across a reddit user 21F who was dying of stage 4 stomach cancer and she has nobody to tell Looking through her previous posts she s so lonely with no friends in her life I don t even know if she talks to her family at all she never said if she did And I relate to her so much on her loneliness Not only that she s dying of cancer I can t image the emotional pain of dying and not having anyone by your side I wanted to give her a hug and offer her some comfort towards the end Make sure she at least has someone by her side She hasn t posted anything in 2 weeks I think she s dead Do not give this post any awards I feel like that would be insensitive I got so emotional writing this to where I actually cried ,0
Reached the end of my rope Alcoholism worse than ever Hey my name is Ben I ve struggled with depression and self imagine issues for years I lost 80 pounds and consider myself a good looking kid But for months I ve been just seen as a option by all these girls or I m used and tossed aside Recently I told a girl that I ve had a crushed on since we were kids that I had feeling for her and she said she wanted to grab a bite to eat and that she was happy I told her Sounds great right No I then asked if that was a date or something and she left me on read and ignored me ever since My last relationship was abusive and toxic and after that I ve just wanted to find a decent person that fits me perfectly but everyone I ve met has been cold or inconsiderate I took to drinking to dull the pain because I now constantly ask myself if anything is wrong with me and I m starting to believe there is It s the worst feeling in the world looking in the mirror and wanting to spit in your own reflection ,0
I ve been doing this for 16 years so I guess I can survive another 14 if you have Edit with such a wealth of experience do you have any advice or tips I know it takes work and there aren t short cuts ,0
mind has this going for months nowDrink powdered Xanax to be absorbed faster snort lines of blow to disturb the body system with ups amp downs then take gun shots to the heart when drugs start to take effect to be disable the possibilities of surviving Doing all far from a hospital location since a gun shot to the heart can cause death within 5 8 minutes depending what location is perforated along with other traumas to the body to respond I think is not ideal how people always shoot their head lol so many possibilities of surviving amp you will have a disfigured painful outcome The heart is the blood circulation source it can disrupt the oxygen blood from the brain The drugs will stop the heart much faster after the trauma This are just my thoughts idk if to just keep going Hell is out for everyone but some of us get tired to fight against the excessive amount of pain emptiness hopelessness not belonging life loses betrayals amp give up No one to alarm just sharing the deadly thoughts with strangers ,0
I just attempted to kill myself but I don t know why I didn t go through with itI ve been feeling very suicidal for the past week and a half so about 20 minutes ago I finally tried to hang myself with a belt of mine but as it was around me and I was choking and struggling to breathe I stopped myself and took off the belt and stared at it for a bit I tried again and the same thing I was trying to think of why to stay but I have nothing I feel nothing at all No emotion I ve given up So why couldn t I go through with it ,0
Suicide seems like the only way I glean avoid going to school or workI can t think of a better option,0
Has anyone ever felt like you wanna hurt yourself cause you feel like that s what you deserve like you wanna leave scars on your body cause you hate it and honestly worse than that too that you didn t wake up in the morning or ever again you love someone who can t love or doesn t wanna love you you lose a loved one and it haunts you you can t sleep you feel unloved and that if you disappeared tomorrow no one would notice that you deserve pain and life is just misery and hell and Everyone you love will be gone one day and it will just be you ,0
inside my head why are there two different people inside of me fighting over what decisions i make depressive bipolar sucks i think i might have a personality disorder ,0
These past few days I ve been feeling better The last time I felt like this I tried making friends but then depression hit me again and I ended up hurting them I m afraid of being okay,0

What a waste I have beenI am 48 years old and my life has been a waste Relatively soon I will die Maybe in 20 years maybe tomorrow it doesn t matter Once I am dead and everyone who knew me dies too it will be as though I never existed What difference has my life made to anyone None that I can think of None at all I know we re all pretty small in the big scheme of things and I suppose the most you can hope for is to make some kind of difference but what kind of difference have I made What in the world is better because of me Nothing that I can think of Nothing at all I don t fit in here I don t fit in anywhere No friends None at all No girlfriend since 2008 Loneliness has been my constant companion for so long that I no longer remember what it feels like to not feel lonely The sun is setting here and soon it will be dark Another night swimming in shadows Perhaps tonight is the night that I ll finally drown in them ,0
I ask myself daily will my extra efforts towards a better life improve my overall mood Will I indeed get happier with a better quality of life It s a constant battle in my head and I feel stuck most days due to it Emotionally I don t feel connected with anyone including family and friends Describing how I feel pouring out my everyday thoughts makes me believe my family and friends think I m deranged or crazy Everyone calls me selfish for contemplating suicide but no one will exert their presence until I m gone No one will help me feel alive while I m alive So what s the point in living Sure I can become a millionaire and have a wonderful life full of materialistic things yet if I die unhappy will I have really lived ,0
I ve wanted to die for years And when it got really bad I did what I was supposed to I reached out got help and started taking meds Everyone thinks I m on the right track I have a job and an apartment and a relationship I see friends and laugh and talk I go to the gym and cook and function well But I can just feel myself losing my will to keep going What is there left in life to look forward to I want to die the pain is so bad but I don t want to hurt the people I love ,0
i feel like im going insane right now but im okay with it things are running through my head and for sme reason i dont have the energy to care i dont feel like im going to live to be able to drink and thats something ive accepted ,0
it only gives us more pain than what we had to begin with ,0
I hear ya If I were someone else I d spit on me for being such a useless fuck ,0
My mum was explaining to me that depression is a choice or excuse that people use She was explaining to me that she was depressed until she decided not to be and decided to play a different character This is obviously very frustrating for me to hear as someone that is trying their best every day but still not meeting their parents expectations A part of me is even wondering if maybe she s right and if I just tried harder maybe I could do better ,0
Hopefully having this stickied will raise awareness and at least cut down on the accidental incitement ,0
I tried killing myself last nightI dont really like talking about myself like this but I feel like my room mates just dont care anymore Last night after a pretty bad fight with my girlfriend I started to feel like even when I try my best it doesnt matter Its not good enough Im not good enough for my career Im not a good boyfriend Im not a good son I was such a shitty kid to my mom while she died of cancer I didnt do enough and the guilts killing me The pressures to be an adult and have a job and a house and everything just drills into me more and more I want out I miss my mom I miss being a kid I dont know what I plan to accomplish with this post the sinking feelings I felt last night are coming back again I think its only a matter of time at this point ,0
Pray for me,0
I cannot escape my thoughts or the reality I created when people talk I don t even hear them my thoughts take over I pushed a bit away who loved me I am fucking done tuck this shit I used to be spiritual but I hope it s a sleep a dark sleep forever this can t follow mw,0
September 1st 2020I m taking my life on 9 1 20 My life is completely hopeless and it s not gonna get any better My family is ruined and it s all my fault I can t just fucking accept the consequences to my actions Last time I attempted suicide I failed I ruined my family I ruined everything Next time I wont fail I ll finally be able to let go I ll finally be at peace I just have to pretend I m okay until then I just have to pretend so no one stops me If I fail this time the consequences will be far worse I know I still have a month I know this isn t well written and I m sorry for that ,0
tales of a suicidal cowardi m too scared to kill my self i m worried about consequences too much and i don t want my family to deal with finding my body and the embarrassment of explaining their daughter wiped herself off the planet i m not religious i d probably consider myself an atheist but my anxiety and how i was raised makes me worried about the fiery pit of hell waiting for me i just want an escape i want to be able to go through the rituals of preparing to end my life but at the same time i m too depressed to even shower properly how could i collect all my supplies and make everything at peace all of this has made me extremely reckless with my life i hope someone isn t paying attention and accidentally kills me to save me the time and effort it would be easier on anyone that cares about me to be able to blame another living being for my death rather than accepting i reached out to receive no help and blew my brains out i don t want to hurt anymore,0
Something is brewing within I ve been reading though a lot of these posts and don t identify with many of the issues people have I m healthy stable life and nothing to really be sad about and not depressed as far as I can tell However more and more I sit alone and get a sudden thought of how it wouldn t be so bad to no longer be alive I m trying to process this and understand if it s a normal occurrence with others or the start of something deeper Anyone share this experience ,0
These past few days I ve been feeling better The last time I felt like this I tried making friends but then depression hit me again and I ended up hurting them I m afraid of being okay,0

Have been depressed for months I have 2 tumors and I ve never felt so happy Can anyone relate I ve always felt too weak to survive the hardships of life and now I might have a chance to accept death without having to deal with building up the courage to do it myself ,0
I wouldn t describe it as steering life in desired direction if that was the case I wouldn t be here talking about how much my life sucks I m moreso taking the wheel of the ship and aiming it where ever I could care less if I drift to sea or crash onto some rocks I m just aimless,0

Tell me about it you ve put it extremely well It s made me depressed for years now just thinking about and how hopeless I feel and just how isolating it is viewing the world like this when so many don t I have deducted though that nothing can be done but I will do what I WANT and won t give a dam what other people think of my lifestyle My sister is the worst example of this she has this hustle mentality and it honestly makes me sick I hate how people are instantly labeled as entitled or lazy if they truly hate working,0

I always read that telling people you trust is the best option for getting help but it just feels meaningless when they tell me I should think about my future and how I should fight for my life when I m suicidal Literally all I see for my future is suicide and if not then unemployed pathetic still relying on my parents etc I feel like a baby that isn t trying and I m convinced that I really am just lazy and not trying but why should I when I see no point in it I plan to kill myself soon anyways None of it will matter You just get mad and insult or laugh at me when I tell you that so I won t and your eyes are always filled with judgement I don t get why you don t want to tell me to kill myself instead of going through the struggle of telling me why I shouldn t,0

I always feel sad about the future and wanting to go to the pass and I always spend my entire day with that sad reality But then something happens and I feel like I m going to die or get existential despair And then those feelings basically anything other than that feels silly And I think that makes sense as when I was in high school I always struggled with social anxiety insecurities etc and then without those stuff like worrying about grades kinda disappeared a bit So when a thing happens that s more dramatic than what your traditionally going through it drowns out all feelings Which makes me think those other feelings are fake I want to create a world filled with possibilities and show everyone inside of this world I want to show the world my deep secrets that only I can feel and spread it to everyone ,0

Is the name of a beautiful song I came across tonight Thinking to myself there s only 2 only people in my life I could really ever tell my depression and suicidal thoughts to I don t want to hurt either of them I still want to end it despite wanting help Why ,0
I just want to end itI wanna commit suicide I contemplated it before and nearly did it about 3 months ago I wanna do it because I moved from another country I hate my stepmother I lost almost all chance of getting into an Ivy League school because of the move and the recent climate surrounding acceptance I m fat and can t seem to get rid of it even after exercising for 2 hours a day and eating well I was born into the worst economic depression the world has ever seen in modern history I have friends but they are either half a world away or feel fake I haven t even kissed a girl I hate myself constantly am anxious and only made my new friends by accident I know the reason I don t dream is because my mind hides them from me because I have had nightmares that made myself sleep in my room with a knife because even though I knew it wasn t real I just couldn t and I feel as if I ve already reached the peak in my life even though I m not even in high school yet ,0
Rather not exist anymoreI rather would not exist anymore or possibly do something that incapicates myself until death I wish this was the 50s so I could get a lobotomy ,0

Just wrote my suicide note Felt so calm Why No I won t divulge my boohoohoo stories You lots are miserable enough as it is ha ha Had bouts of depression suicidal and it got worse the last 2 years Yesterday I wrote my suicide note For some reason afterwards I felt happy a bit Calmer though I did think death even more now surprise I felt invincible or sorts But when I was at the convenience shop earlier nearly broke down crying I don t get it Edit Just in 2 hours I already felt how therapeutic a support can be I mean even dogs need and get talked to what more a human being ,0
Seems to happen a lot in team environments or workplaces It becomes a regular occurrence where coworkers will come to you with their grievances about another person and it s been said that if people talk shit about others to you they probably talk shit about you to others as well For some reason its never bothered me to think about that that up in the air unconfirmed knowledge of someone saying bad things about you But then someone lets it slip in conversation that some thoughts concerning you that you were unaware of have been passed around That part absolutely sucks knowing something s happening but not the specifics of it or how people actually feel about you now ,0
i ask myself this question almost every day it s not even that my life has been horrible it s just been so utterly disappointing at every turn i m only 17 but i feel like my life so far has been completely wasted i haven t done anything particularly noteworthy so far and probably never will if i were to disappear tomorrow nobody would really notice outside of my family and my one friend i feel like this whole time i ve been desperately waiting for my life to begin but it never has i ve been in anxiety hell for the past year and a half and i just need some relief i promise im not suicidal so plz dont dm just so you can save me just finally examining these thoughts that have been piling up for a long time ,0
I have been enjoying traveling when I can I ve done a little this year now that I m vaccinated I have some concerts coming up that should be great My life isn t completely joyless fortunately Just the cons vastly outweigh the pros It doesn t feel worth it ,0
yes I never cried so much like that ,0
I can t handle any kind of stressThe title sums it up really Anything bad that happens irrespective of magnitude or impact really throws me into a downward spiral of anxiety and depression I don t even want that bad thing to get better at this point cause I know I m going to get back here when something else goes wrong in my life And I keep fucking up so that s not too far away I have people who love me and that s guilting me into not doing it I just don t know if it s worth my sanity anymore There are kids who die of cancer man They d give anything to not die And on the other hand there s me I have everything but not the will to live I m such an ungrateful pos I m sorry for the poorly formatted rant Just needed to say this to somebody ,0
For all my life ive battled with depression It started ever since the age of 6 when i lost all my hair due to a condition and left me inhibited and paranoid of the world Ive gotten better recently im 20 but i still have this extreme sensitivity to other peoples perception of me Any sort of rejection and i go this depression pit that i cant get out of for a while Luckily i havent experienced any devastating events such as a death of a loved one but i am deeply afraid when the inevitable does happen I dont think when my parents eventually die ill be able to sustain myself ,0
They say bullies peak in school I was 12 years old this dude who was 15 randomly beat the shit out of me He was always popular in school while I was ostracised Now he is 21 with a beautiful girlfriend who loves him he has a good social circle happy in life The other people who mainly bullied me are also in relationships and are living a good life I m now 18 bullied throughout my life haven t had a friend in 5 years had to move highschool twice thought about suicide for ages People say it gets better in life bullies peak in highschool I was diagnosed with aspergers at 4 never wanted to harm anyone in my entire life yet here I am living this pathetic existence Even my parents don t understand They keep thinking it will get better It won t I m just done No one gets it ,0
I don t care anymore what happens to me Will cut tonight from the first time in years I though I could make it and that was so dumb I was so fucking stupid nothing will ever be better but foremost I will never get well I need to hurt myself I need to see blood I hate living and everyone hates me too I feel my heart can t take it It s like a wall that s oppressing me and I feel cornered with no escape I just feel all I have is the will to die and how to do it and how to hurt me And I will hurt myself and hopefully I will die once and for all ,0
There is no way you could make a post recommending your r gime that wouldn t get you banned so just don t minefield of rules We serve a vulnerable population None of them are unnecessary If you re here as a helper it s a lot easier to focus on what is allowed You may respond selectively to OPs you feel you can relate to with individualised emotional support Nothing else ,0
What does motivation feel likeI don t know if I ve ever felt real emotion I ve never been attracted to anybody I barely have friends and the ones I do have are distancing themselves from me because i beg them for drugs I don t even know what gets me out of bed in the morning I eventually make it to class but not until 2 3 hours into the day I have almost anything material a high schooler would want but I don t feel anything inside I don t have plans specifically on how and when I m gonna go In all honesty I m just a mix of sad and bored Nothing excites me or gets me going and watching my family and friends fall apart trying to help me is depressing as fuck Even picturing myself with Jeff bezos levels of money and a loving happy family wouldn t make me feel any different I don t know what to do ,0
I m so tired of this pain everybody treats me like crap just end me already,0
Tired of livingSometimes I wonder what s the point of living anymore maybe if i killed myself I would be reborn as someone else and start over my life again I know I royally fucked up this one maybe I can start a new game Partly why I think like this is because I know its not gonna get better I already fucked my life goals and even I achieved them later they wouldn t really be satisfying cause I m older Its rather out of desperation than outta passion ,0
I wish that I could feel something other than nausea thinking about him out there with other women It makes me sick It makes me want to cry and scream and I just don t know how to cope ,0
My life is pointlessI don t have anyone who truly loves me I lost someone for good He said I m a crazy and horrible person I don t want to die I just want to be a normal twenty year old But too much time has already been wasted and I m just getting worse The pain I feel is unbearable and I really don t want to hurt anyone but I m afraid I already have I feel like I m going crazy and I hate who I am I just want to be good and normal Everyday recently I just wait until I can fall asleep and not feel pain anymore It s not fair that people get normal lives I ve been trying for so long ,0
I m 15 16 in well I guess a week now August 1st but I don t want to make it that long I have a pretty good life but I am so depressed and hate myself so much and I m sitting here on the couch sobbing with some mild medicine that I know with enough of I can overdose on and just looking for a reason to stay I guess I don t know what I m waiting for I really put myself out there to help other people but I want to be selfish for once and act on my feelings even if it hurts them because it ll help me,0
I think it s time for me to say my final goodbyes to this Earth There is so much boiling hate with the people I left and the people that have left me It was all worthless since the day that I came to this hell they call Earth Nobody can save me because I m impossible to save Don t even bother saying that s it s all going to get better The void inside that I have doesn t get filled but gets even bigger everyday that I wake up to this fucking pain I went through so many suicide attempts and I think I don t regret every single one I don t want to know about what s going happen next with my goddamn life Every fucking voice in my head is always telling me to die a fast death I think I have reached the point where there is nothing else to discover I said I was going to kill myself pretty soon so I think this the way my life is going to end Thanks for 18 miserable fucking years ,0
Does anyone else just want to die casually No worrying about getting better not worrying about improving just waiting for it to happen in one way or another Suicidal thoughts shouldn t even be labeled as such anymore they re just my regular everyday constant thoughts ,0
I am blessed to have you who loves me so much and shows me that I am worthy But why am I still so sad Why do I feel like even when our knees touch I m like two worlds away from you who holds my hand so tightly and tells me you re here I wish I could show you how much I love you and be as happy as you are I feel like I m still in a fog Despite the meds But I do love you so much and I hope me telling you that is enough Even if I seem distant or in a daze ,0

This is why people don t seek help This is why people refuse to open up because they re constantly being let down This is why it s easier to keep everything bottled up I express to my doctor that I haven t been feeling the same for a while I feel empty I have panic attacks I feel suicidal and it was met with Just take yourself to the movies You ll feel better This isn t a big deal I won t prescribe you medications because I don t think you need it Just try to get out of the house more Now I m left feeling lonelier than ever before Fuck you We all deserve better Everyone struggling right now I hear you and I hope you find and get the help you deserve Your feelings matter ,0

At that point where I ve absolutely exhausted every avenue of trying to get better nothing I mean nothing works I thought about it really long and no one cares about me so I don t wanna here that bs about oh your family is going to be so sad well they had the time to help me and refused Im unloved unwanted and used up I really want to just go really fast and crash into a wall but I don t wanna be a veggie for my whole life how fast would one have to crash into a wall at to forsure end my life ,0

I recently started giving therapy through Betterhelp a shot and after a couple months all she s done is listen then suggest I try going outside scheduling tasks and activities journaling Is this how therapy normally is Just an endless list of suggestions I already know will help but I don t have the motivation or energy to try in the first place I used to do these things when I was in school but it s so hard for me to do anything now Sure the little accountability I get from her is somewhat helpful but It s starting to feel like cure your depression by doing things that should be easy My husband went to therapy a while ago and refuses to try it again because it was useless I m kind of starting to believe him since I can get all this advice from self help websites ,0
Is anyone else like this If I don t accomplish what I need to before 2pm I m out of luck because after that all I can do is scroll through Reddit and stew in my misery,0

I ve had a funny feeling lately Kind of unusual It s like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work When I awoke it was already dark and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable It almost felt like a panic attack in a way Yet my heart was not racing Yet I felt on edge and so so very alone I busied myself with some quick chores Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly They even called and it s like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade I just do not understand it well I ve lived alone for several years now and I m accustomed to it even prefer it at times And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison Completely intolerable I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that I know I ve been a bit depressed lately I m wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way ,0
i think im dyingeither that or severely dissociating but it doesn t really matter i wish i would die i haven t done anything about it but it feels it s time feels like if i lie down tonight i will not wake up and maybe it s better this way,0
Friends are supportive I m so happy about that Finally told some of my friends that I was planning to leave I think it s a testament of how long I ve suffered and thought about this that they didn t argue with me and instead said they d support me and be by my side Ah the end is near and somehow that mitigates the pain a little ,0

Uk guy 44m Well its been 7 days since i was stopped from killing myself In that time i have had another failed attempt and have begun to cut myself I have reached out to crisis centres and my GP all of whom told me that im not a serious risk As i write this i just dont know what to do Im single ugly and pretty vulnerable now I dint want to die but says it all when cutting myself is a viable option I work in a hospital and the pressures are immense right now I dont drink or take drugs but my cigarette intake is up to at least 40 a day As sad as it sounds i just want a friend to talk to Someone for me to ask how their day was Anything to take my mind away from how utterly hopeless and useless i feel Im worried that my 3rd suicide attempt will be successful But then again i just want the pain to stop If the relevant services here dont give a shit about me why should i give a shit about me ,0

It pains me that this has happened to me Grandpa died before my eyes when I was 9 years old and my father got cancer and he died when I was 13 years old I am afraid that these two events have changed my brain structure permanently and I will always be prone to depression I quit smoking and suddenly became severely depressed I had to go to a psychiatrist right away It just hurts me that it happened to me I would like to look at the world positively but I can t I am only 20 years old after my dad died my grandmother promised me that nothing bad would happen to me but she was wrong I don t want to fight depression most of my life I wish I had a normal life like the rest of my family no one died in their childhood It pains me that this has happened to me It hurts me that my life would have been better if they hadn t died My childhood was good but death destroyed it Fate sucks ,0

I noticed when I ve told my friends and family that I got Covid again and have to quarantine I ve had people not reach out to me to see how I m doing Its like they feel some sort of pity for me and honestly makes me feel ashamed about myself Nobody reaches out to me or calls me to see how I m doing Not even my own family really cares Its like they are supposed to care but not out of genuineness What makes me livid is that they are still going out knowing fully well I have covid and im quarantine in my room I feel so lonely and unloved Why do people ostracize you when you re going through a difficult time I felt the same way when I went through melanoma cancer a few years back I had some friends stop reaching out to me Its awful and its like I m reliving all over again ,0

My only current friend is clearly depressed and they feel like they just want to f ing die and i don t know what to do or say about it I met them on Discord in late February and especially recently they ve seemed very depressed because of all the pressure from showing that they re doing better to the people around them and possibly because their parents almost disowned them for being asexual non binary I think they also feel like no one cares about them except for me cause i just told them that i do care a lot about them I live in the Netherlands but they live in Ukraine so we can t speak in person only over text Discord calls They also said today that they appreciate my help ,0

i just really wanna dieI ve never actually posted anything on reddit before and this will probably be my last but hi I ve been suicidal for the past 8 or 9 months and the feeling gets worse and worse everyday and i don t know what to do anymore i can t talk to anyone close to me because i don t want to burden them with this shit ya know so I ve felt very alone I m just not happy ever i forget what it feels like to be happy and I ve honestly been planning on killing myself on my 17th birthday but I m pretty religious and I m pretty sure god isn t very fond of suicide sadly so I ve been praying some freak accident happens so i wouldn t have to deal with that but I m reaching out to y all maybe to gain some perspective i guess cause my view of the world and myself is pretty bleak so yeah ,0
Thoughts of jumping Even though I am not feeling as suicidal as I once was a couple of years ago I can t help but feel compelled to make plans and sometimes I zone out and be like you know that bridge I am thinking about in the city would be easy to jump off of like the barrier on it is kinda short and I could just climb over it But the only thing stopping me is actually going there the travel time and having my brain committing to it Like if I was instantly transported to a location where I d want to do it I wouldn t hesitate to jump over because my brain wouldn t have any time to reason with itself and I wish I could do that I feel lucky that I don t have easy access to things like guns in my country otherwise I would be long gone and things in my life feel like they are going fine despite the everlasting depression like I have a mostly alright family friends and a new boyfriend however I can t help but feel these intrusive thoughts that I can t shake ,0

Rules broken and fixed but though i might share some point of view mod In the info section it s mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed Although again yes positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad intentioned PMs but i think i just need to share this I don t know if the english is too confusing or understandable though Anyway cheers for your wholesome effort ,0
Hi guys I was just wondering what are some of the things you do on your low days When I say low I mean days where you feel like you re just constantly in the way or being a disruption to other people s lives I feel I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt for existing and I d like to deal with it and learn to comfort myself when I experience this feeling If you are comfortable I d love to hear what other people do when they are feeling similar to this ,0

Handcuffed and thrown in the back seat of a police car for suicidal Idealation Yes folks when you are suicidal and tell someone you are treated like a criminal Escorted and forced to go to the hospital kept there and observed by cops and transported to the loony bin handcuffed and thrown into the back seat Then stip searched loaded on meds You have no say in what you want to take when you want to sleep and have nothing or do but wander around and watch whatever they play on the single television Then you ar ekept there until you lie and and pretend you are no longer suicidal or your insurance runs out This has happened to me twice Two other times I lied during my evaluation at the hospital to avoid being commited Great insight into how our society handles people who are in tremendous pain and suffering huh ,0
Could someone explain something to me What part of there isn t a day when I don t think it would ve been better if I was never born mean that my mental health is fine and I should stop seeing a therapist My therapist will probably kick me out since it s gonna be impossible to diagnose me with anything their manual specifically says that my circumstances don t meet their criteria and that it d meet it if I had made money on what got me into this mess I mean at least make it one way or the other I was doing something that would meet their criteria for six and a half nights a week for months but it only counts if it s your job I used my free time So according to them getting paid for something means your worthy of help doing it for free means they have an excuse to kick you out But who am I to say anything I feel like I don t deserve to live but on paper I m fine Link to more explanation and being told I don t need a therapist since my mental health is fine  ,0
AspirationI ve long viewed suicide for myself as foolishly aspirational like the couch potato dreaming of getting in shape I say this with levity but sincerely nonetheless ,0

Where is that place I m moving there right now ,0
I feel like a lifeless body moving around This summer I tried everything I could do to be productive On the bright side I ve established good habits that weren t there before But at the same time I get frustrated when I lose the streak of tasks and forget to follow through with these good habits Even though some would say that I ve grown as a person I still feel like nothing has changed and that I m worthless until I am able to actually stick to something I don t even have the motivation to fully explain my emotions because all the energy is sucked out of me Lately I realized how narcissistic I am for craving validation when I know it s not the best driving force 2021 is possibly my worst year yet because it feels like there s no reward for all that I ve done Was all this pain worth it or am I just running in circles ,0

Suffering with medical problems while trying to juggle a full time job that I m verbally abused at everyday depression anxiety and grieving the loss of a 3 year relationship is really beating me down Today I had to leave my job an hour early because I was feeling so sick I never have energy I m about to lose this job and have to go back to working fast food which gives me a panic attack just thinking about it I literally don t have any other options because there is no other jobs in my area I ll lose my insurance and be unable to go to the doctor I feel so lost and broken down I feel like such a failure at life right now ,0
I know people talk about how much we hate ourselves a lot here because it s very common for depressed people I was wondering though if others feel this A rational part of my brain knows I shouldn t hate myself as much as I do because the level of hate i have for myself is the same as the level I have for the worst people Now I might be kinda a worthless piece of shit but also I m not that bad I dont get violent with people I ve never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people Probably the worst I ve done is say some hurtful things and lie Even though the rational part of my brain can look through all this and go well i guess you arent the worst piece of shit it dosent really effect how I feel about myself I still hate everything about me from my stupid body to my stupid mind I know its probably a bit much for what I am but god fucking hate me ,0
 thanks for help and for your support i appreciate it You saved me guys Please help me I know that some people may think im an egoist or lazy idiot but i just in a bad situation I think im close to jump from the building but my familly doesnt pay attention i still love them I stuck in that life dont know what should i do lost my loved ones metaphorical and literally Please i just begging you please just talk to me Im sorry to tell it because in that case seems like i dont give a fuck about others but if so im really sorry Sorry for all that waste of time i wrote,0
Someone I live with showed me where they keep their prescribed medication and I wish they hadn t I feel so stupid even considering it but I ve struggled with staying away from stuff like that in the past I want to pour it out but I m sure they d notice The fucked up thing is it s the same medication someone I cared about used to k1ll themselves ,0
Can t Stand It Anymore I m 18 I hardly had any friends in high school I m not good at sports or video games I Get average grades when it comes to school I can t remember the last time I was happy The simple fact that i will never be great or even good at something kills me I just hate myself and there is only one way i can think of to stop hating myself ,0
I m about to start going to the psychiatristI m scared I really am I m 24 with 2 kids and going through separation with my wife she left me I ve been feeling depressed and suicidal since I was 10 years old but the separation and the pandemic took me to a point where I was with a belt on my neck just about to suicide but I decided to take another chance because I was already going with a psychotherapist and I told her all of my suicidal ideas which I had never talked about with anyone besides my wife she told me that I might need medication so I m ready to start not feeling anxious and depressed all day Hopefully it will work I ll try to keep my story and progress in here because I think it will encourage people to get help and be hopeful that we all can get through all that struggle ,0

 Don t leave me I have a few times vented to my friends about my feelings One time my friend told me she d kill herself as well if I did Don t leave me I feel so heavy So sick whenever I think of it It s not a comforting tether keeping me alive It s like painful hard shackles I feel like I m physically fighting to stay alive and I m fucking exhausted ,0
 x200B I agree 100 with you but at the same time i feel we deserve it If we re not capable to take actions as individual and as group than we re no better than a herd that need to be controlled We ll be taken advantage of as long as we let it happen It s not easy it s unfair but it s reality If each time a big corp or an individual fucked us over we made them pay harshly we wouldn t be where we are I m not saying it would resolve everything but at least it wouldn t be done in our face without repercussion ,0

Is everything just pain I read that we as humans only want to betray others and will do so to feel better about ourselves with little to no regret at all We re all probably hypocrites in various degrees but we are Every single year no matter how much we try to avoid it we piss off people we break promises we fail others and others fail us as well That s why I feel that nothing makes sense Why only a few people feel like this Why can most people have happy fulfilling lives without questioning their existence Why do I feel like my entire existence has been nothing but lies and sadness Sorry if this sounds selfish but I wonder if I made a microscopic difference in the world surrounding me I wonder if I truly managed to do something to prove my existence and not just being someone who s easily forgotten replaced and discarded ,0

I understand why I was so frustrated the and did the things I did I was so used to thinking about those events as recent now they feel like such a long time ago and I don t feel like I was me I still yearn for the same things I yearned for then I haven t spoken to anyone seriously for the past 4 YEARS But I know once I do speak to someone seriously and gain feelings it will end badly so I don t do it The only solution is the exact same solution I came to years ago and that s to remember so that I can go home It plays over and and over again as a reality and I still don t learn All I ever wanted was friends a community a group I m so afraid now to start over again it s insanity But I should be afraid Everybody is out to get me no one has ever liked me I m just a stupid dumb person set to live miserable There hate is warranted though The reality of existence is that it doesn t matter for what reason or how much you suffer if you don t fit within society they will deny you and you will die a cold death ,0
These are exactly my thoughts Right now I can t even go to a therapist because of my ocd But I also think would it helped if I just went for one hour and speak When I sit every night in my mom s car and crying I m alone When I sit everyday in my balcony I m also alone My mom doesn t have the ability to help me so who else can ask for help Even if I gave them more money would they go out of their way to call me on the phone or meet me outside of their office If I would send them a message at night they would never answer me They have their own lives and have to deal with so many people so they can t give to anyone real help If someone is in a very serious situation they can t really do nothing They will just give you medication to become numb they can t help to deal with your life s crisis ,0

So this isn t really a question or anything just something I think about sometimes that I wanted to put out there I realised a while ago that to love someone is to know them I know this has been said several times but still It s knowing small things about people and loving them because of that and paying attention to those things in order to make them happy And I realised that no one will ever love me because they don t know anything about me and they never will because I am nothing I m not nothing but I like nothing I can t talk about anything and I feel like I can t get interested in anything no matter how hard I try I feel like because of this no one will ever love me and I m trying to be okay with that but I m just not ,0

FinalI m drinking my final drink right now hot chocolate It s a bit too hot It s burning my throat just a little But that s okay because I won t need to worry about that soon Soon I ll be saying my final goodbye Bye to my older brother bye to my cat I guess I should feel guilty for leaving them and I do but my preoccupation with death is stronger than that Then my final walk Down to the train tracks where I ll wait There s a chance a train won t come and that ll delay me by a day or so But I don t mind I can come back tomorrow if need be Then my final breath I ll relish in the moment where I can only feel pain as a million pounds of steel roll over me And I ll be dead final glimpse of the world final heartbeat final moment And then I won t have to worry about anything Writing this actually kind of calmed me so I m not going to go kill myself now but I m still posting this ,0

The only moments I m somewhat happy are when I m with my girlfriend but the days after are just so much worse Is it maybe better to not see her anymore so I don t get so misserable after every time I see her Is it selfish to try to be happy when in the end I m going to leave her anyways Or am I just self sabotaging ,0

I always think about ascending past the pain and sorrow and then think wow if I could ascend past it then everything would be ok But that s irrelevant Because the fact that that pain exist in the first place proves this world is wrong There has to be a meaning right But even if there s a meaning what is the meaning behind that meaning WHY The only thing I can think of is that all our pain is meaningless or it s beyond human comprehension I really hope it s beyond human comprehension and all the pain in this world is balanced out or some event happens once we die I m so afraid so afraid of my future I ve been lucky up until this point to stable myself out but there are definitely others that weren t as fortunate as me I always think and feel so fortunate at times that my situation isn t worse but that s not an excuse If someone is being abused and one should goes by well you shouldn t be happy One thing for sure the happiness doesn t out weigh the misery ,0

just attempted but failedme and my family was about to go somewhere today so i saw this as my chance to be a stubborn brat and do everything i can in my power so they will go without me leaving me alone to get money and buy sodium nitrite and all the important drugs to OD on but being a incompetent fool i left the house and came back 2 times just because i hadn t researched properly as to where the shop that has sodium nitrite is it doesn t help that i don t speak the language of where i live and now im just tired and miserable because by now the shops would have closed by now im just hoping they won t notice anything being off but it still makes me anxious af i saw this subreddit as a place to vent and i guess im doing that right now ill still get my chance sooner or later so as long as they don t figure ill find a out of this life so i guess there s a silver lining somewhere,0

I want to die but I m too afraid of the painI don t see any hope in living anymore There s nothing that I m good at nor is there anything left that I enjoy I waste away my time watching TV or playing stupid games just to kill the time until I die But still every single day is like a torture and I want to get it over with but I m just too afraid to die I ve been thinking about suicide for years but I never had the courage Recently the pain has become overwhelming and all that s holding me back is the fear of the pain when dying I m a failure I m a parasite I have no worth living I fail at everything even dying I m not even worth to talk to people I should just die lonely in a fucking corner of my room But I m so afraid I can t stand this torment any longer Edit Thank you for your help I managed to get some sleep and I guess I ll try once more to get help ,0
Don t want to talk to my therapistI don t want to tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts because I feel like I m just being an attention seeking piece of shit I mean I ve attempted suicide like once and got close but idk if I d do it now or not I ve been having suicidal thoughts but I don t think I d actively commit suicide I d just do something reckless like start doing heroin or binge drink until I pass out or almost die I just feel like bringing up my shitty vaguely suicidal thoughts to her would be being an attention seeking bitch although that doesn t really make sense since I m paying her to listen to my shit ,0

Just called the national suicide hotline Tried hanging myself tonight Again Failed Again I m 6 4 It s really fucking hard to hang yourself Broke down and called the hotline I just needed someone to talk to I didn t mention that I was staring at a noose that was around my neck 15 minutes prior mostly because I can t deal with going back to a hospital right now I m 700 miles away from anyone I know I live in a new city now and there s no one that can take care of my dog should I be admitted Not to mention that I m already in massive debt because of medical and legal bills from past suicide attempts 13 minutes later David is basically saying I just need to straighten out my life and that he s going to let me go now Followed by both of us hanging up Guess I wasn t suicidal enough or my problems weren t bad enough ,0
At 19 I ve reached the lowest I ve been so far Wasting my life extremely unhealthy and my mental health at rock bottom I made the choice too talk to my parents about it and I ve picked 3 things I want to change about myself I ve never been healthy I always hated the way I felt and looked about my weight and I ve spent the last 19 years coping through it and now I ve finally fell apart My 3 changes are no more biting nails exercising daily as well as eating good foods and taking care of my sleep With these 3 changes I will be one step closer to achieving my true self Today is Day 1 and I started the day with a 5km brisk walk I ll grab some lunch then work on my photography I ll go out for a walk again later at 6 o clock ,0

Maybe practice interviews can help Do you have someone who can help you do that Can you do it with a mirror or maybe there are charities that help people get jobs who can do this Is your stammering a real speech impediment that you can get help for specifically That said I don t want to invalidate how bad you feel It sucks being nervous around people Especially in interviews I just start talking too much is my problem Say dumb sounding things as s result ,0

Haven t heard any bit of new advice in years It s always the same thing that doesn t work It s seeming like your life has to be super easy or you have to be really stupid to have advice help I ve exhausted everything years ago Here I am failed every college class I ve ever taken lost every breif job I ve ever had had every girl I ve met leave me every friend too and I can t handle life I m in my early 20s but I m not YOU when YOU were in your early 20s I can t make things happen even now It s already over I feel like I ve heard everything and tried everything I guess this is where it ends finally It s better than cracking under pressure and ending up in jail at least but that s apparently my fault because everyone else is used to having a life that allows them to do what they want Knowing reddit I feel like this place won t help but I m just so done I dont care Or maybe I ll literally be the only person not to get their post approved as one last FU before I go,0

So I ve had issues with depression in the past But even when I m not depressed I constantly think about ending my life I won t deny that depression makes it more attractive though Right now I have been constantly contemplating it for over a year and have everything required for my method of choice There are certain things that block my actual plan mostly the fact the I had just gotten into a relationship after these thoughts got to this point and now making sure my finances are in order so I don t burden those that would be affected However work is now becoming unbearable and my finances are almost in order I m thinking the time might be right I am not asking for sympathy empathy attention or anyone to talk me down I simply needed to vent to someone that has no emotional investment in my life or lack thereof Thanks Please don t reply If you do any things get better or bs like that is not wanted or needed If I don t care what loved ones think about my choice why would I listen to a stranger Lol ,0

Does any body feels the same way I am so tired I am in a foreign country away living alone away from my family and have not meet friends because of corona lockdown for 2 months already Yet online classes continue and all the requirements are due this week Even on weekends i tried to write a paper and do the final requirements I just want to rest and sleeep now but i cannot afford to do so because I will fail And the reason i went here and be away from my family is to study Havent been home for 2 years too because i cannot afford to go home Requires a lot of money Quarantine hotels to my home country and also going back here plus several pcr tests People that are with their loved ones should be grateful Also those that can afford to travel to meet their loved ones as for me and maybe other people we need to be stronger every day to fight this loneliness and being homesick I hope that this pandemic and situation should soon pass I am not sure if what i am doing is still worth it I am just tired ,0

When we first started dating things were really great She started to move into depression and slowly pushed me away This has happened over about 4 months She always had a reason to be distant I broke up with her because to me it just seemed like she wasn t really into me Now sometime after the breakup im wondering if her creating distance was a normal thing for people with depression and the feelings of being overwhelmed,0
I have been so lucky to work at a job I love for many years I have been lucky to keep my job even though the pandemic I ve sort of got a promotion and a wonderful chance to learn new things Interacting with my co workers instantly makes me want to go home and figure out a way to stop existing They are not loudly toxic I imagine that its a normal amount of passive aggressive backstabbing and bullshit The one lady who sits next to me is nice and superficially friendly mothering sort Who makes passive aggressive comments about me to the women at the other desk while I can hear her and has been putting an anchor on the things she is supposed to be showing me I feel trapped I have only gotten a few hours of sleep I just don t want to do life anymore ,0

The worst depression day ever ,0
I feel like a lifeless body moving around This summer I tried everything I could do to be productive On the bright side I ve established good habits that weren t there before But at the same time I get frustrated when I lose the streak of tasks and forget to follow through with these good habits Even though some would say that I ve grown as a person I still feel like nothing has changed and that I m worthless until I am able to actually stick to something I don t even have the motivation to fully explain my emotions because all the energy is sucked out of me Lately I realized how narcissistic I am for craving validation when I know it s not the best driving force 2021 is possibly my worst year yet because it feels like there s no reward for all that I ve done Was all this pain worth it or am I just running in circles ,0
I ve been feeling really down today and I don t know where to go I was in therapy through my school but when summer started my sessions stopped I was doing okay but right now I really wish I had it again I know I can talk to my friends but honestly I don t want to bring them down and make them feel sad with all my sadness I just want a therapist to talk to Also I m feeling a mix of emotions I don t even know everything I m feeling I just feel really drained and sad Okay just had to let that out What do I do when I don t want to talk to anyone close to me but I also don t have a therapist ,0
every day i hope my country changes their laws about assisted suicide once its legal i will do iti just dont have anything left in my life that would be worth living hopefully Austria soon changes some laws i really would prefer having a peaceful death and not having to swallow a whole box of sleeping pills ,0
Do any of you guys find yourselves wanting to post about how you feel or ask someone to talk but just not being able to It s like something in my brain knows they don t want to talk about that or that it would get out of hand or something Maybe it paranoia idk but it seems like when I feel like I really need help is when I m most scared to look for it What do you guys do when you find yourself feeling hopeless but don t know who or how to talk to someone about it ,0
I hope I don t wake upNot that it matters I can t fall asleep anyway,0

My MI was getting worse and I lost my job because I had to take too many days off Then I fell into a pit of depression for a month I thought if I found a new job I would feel better I got a job and after a day and a half I had to leave I couldn t do it I was a trembling sweaty mess from anxiety and my concentration was shattered The whole day and a half I was using every trick I know to stay sane and nothing was sticking I was totally overwhelmed Now I don t know what I m going to do I know society at large wants me to contribute to capitalism or die trying But the few people who love me don t deserve to be hurt like that I really want to kill myself and get it over with but I ve tried and it s harder than it looks I don t have a gun But I don t have any other solution either Burden people while living or hurt them by dying This world is a fucked up place ,0

I m tiredI m tired I m just so tired of feeling like this I hate having to put on the mask of normalcy every morning to act like I m fine To push myself to laugh and be happy during the right situations I m alienated and alone I hate myself more than I ever have If I had a 100 sure way of getting out right now I would I don t have access to it though Most of the methods I do have access to would result in failure just resulting in more hospital time more people noticing more people faking caring more attention to a problem that I should be able to handle myself I m sorry I m so sorry to all those that love me or may have loved me but this is getting incredibly difficult The greatest thing I am looking forward to is the day when everyone alive has no recollection that I ever existed ,0

Hi everyone My situation was really cool I was happy boy until being 16 17 years old when I discovered my biological sex is different than mental sex Wearing woman clothes makeup doing things like woman makes me really happy and feel normal compared to being in unnatural male body Unfortunately noone around me can understand this I had many friends before now I m talking maybe with one or two mainly about stupid things Everyone else thinks I m weird even my parents who make fun I don t have girlfriend and look more like woman than man Idk what to do I would love to make full transition but it s really expensive and risky I don t have anyone to talk about that and besides moments being woman wearing sexy clothes makeup and getting attention I m constantly sad and often crying I don t even know any girls with I could talk about feminine things like makeup and fashion What do you think I should do with my life If anyone would like to talk with me it would be cool ,0

 I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot He says he feels the same but he doesn t show it We re both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other 5 or 6 times within 3 months why he takes hours to answer messages while always online why he isn t more involved in the relationship He wasn t like that at the beginning and I m not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not I ve been having difficulties trusting people because of one past relationship and I m not sure I believe him 100 although I really want to I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious How can I support him especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he can t give me the relationship I want He says he can t offer me consistency that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next I have no idea what to do and how to do it ,0

After years of trying different antidepressants cymbalta is the one that finally helps me I ve been on it for 6 months It makes a big difference for my depression anxiety and ibs However it causes sexual dysfunction No other antidepressant has done this to me and I had a high sex drive all my life Now my penis feels numb my erections are like 70 percent of what they were orgasms are way harder to achieve and orgasms way less intense I m going to ask my psychiatrist if lowering my dose from 60 to 30 might help and retain most of the benefits My depression anxiety was severe before this med so I don t know what to do At the same time this level of sexual dysfunction would probably render relationships with the opposite sex impossible Also having little sensation in your penis when your 28 is sort of disturbing and makes me feel inhuman in a way Does anyone have similar experiences or advice ,0

How I sleep at nightThis might not be the right sub to post on Sorry if this is the case New to Reddit Does anyone else find comfort in the fact that they might die soon I m not suicidal I think but every night I fall asleep by imagining that I die I don t know whether this counts as suicidal thoughts where my therapist is concerned but it feels pretty normal In my head I pretend that I die I release all the anxiety and stress that s in my life and by doing this I m comforted and am able to sleep better The idea that my life could end and that I might either survive somehow unburdened by life or cease to exist completely is comforting so much that I wish those two options were the case instead of this one I most often imagine drowning being stabbed or shot or falling from a great height I ve imagined a lot more ways to die but these are the most frequent Is this normal Or suicidal ,0

I ve tried everything people recommend and kept at it for several months exercising meditating going out in the sun talking to people being grateful etc I still have a negative mindset and feel like crap on most days The exercise doesn t matter yeah I have more muscles so what How s that of use I wish I cared more about my body but I don t really Meditating just leaves me with my bad thoughts for too long Being grateful for minute things just reminds me that I haven t achieved big things etc The cycle continues and I feel powerless to climb up from the hole I dug myself ,0

The end I can feel it now every day it s been getting closer and closer to the edge I can t keep pretending to be okay I am 21 soon to be 22 I have been depressed I have self harmed 3 suicide attempts and 10 years later 3 years after my last suicide attempt I am still here hearing how it ll get better but it s all fucking lies and bullshit I have lost all meaning and all hope I wish it was easy just one quick simple way of ending everything I am too much of a coward to jump from the balcony I am afraid of the pain when my body hits the asphalt but in the end can it be worse than my eternal suffering on this earth Its just getting worse and I can feel myself slipping away from who I really am I m afraid my brother will get devastated if I would pass but I just want all of this to end Every night I pray I ll die in my sleep Maybe this is it or I ll have to take action ,0
This is the first time I ve posted anything like this I feel like even my private TwitteInstagram has too many people This year in general has been the best year for my mental health until recently I m currently isolating because my housemate has covid and I think it s making my thoughts worse I can t seem to get the energy to do minor tasks anymore when at the start of the year I was jogging working and smashing out my uni work I just keep going back to bed and then if I get out of bed it s to have a cigarette Feeling so lost and struggling to feel genuine in my emotions whether that s in my relationship or around friends I just feel like I m watching the world go by when I used to have so much determination of what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be And I don t really love the person I am anymore or my body image Any little advice on how to start getting motivation self love back or words of encouragement would be really useful x,0
I am a home I m healthy I have friends and family who care so much about me But I wish to God everyday that I died and I feel the selfishness along with the depression My grandfather passed away a couple months ago and I really miss him All my friends are moving away to college and know what they want to do with their lives I don t want to bother them with my problems not when they are about to make amazing memories I love them and I want them to be happy They are good at things My cousins who are my best friends live in another continent in a country where it s almost impossible to visit I see people my age doing amazing things and I feel worthless I just want to sleep all day to forget about it but sometimes I can t fall asleep I feel so ungrateful so selfish when there are so many in the world with no access to what I have and I wish I could give it to them ,0

Don t know what to do anymoreLet s go back in time to yesterday I don t know what made me grab my rope and try to hang myself I really don t know But I did And so there I was content with my life for once and overjoyed but the moment I felt myself fading out I started freaking out until I finally had enough strength to free myself I don t know why I did it why I saved myself So here I am sitting at 2 40 am on reddit after re downloading it onto my phone and I am terrified for my life as I don t know what I truly want anymore I should be over what happened yesterday but my throat still feels constricted and it feels as if I m still there I don t know what to do anymore I don t know if I truly want to die or what snapped in me at the last moment ,0

Potentially the issue though is the costs Starting with a new one I d have to pay for one session to explain my issues again then give it another few sessions to see if they actually are any more help If they still aren t helpful then I could have ended up paying another 150 only to find myself back in the same position I can t afford to keep going through that process each time to try a new one As it is I m probably going to stop my therapy in a few sessions if it doesn t start to help I m on the waiting list for free therapy but that will still be quite some time away months ,0

Its too much effort but people care abut meA lot of people seem to be suicidal because they don t think don t know people care about them I am also busy looking at ways to kill myself but they all seem to painful and in Australia its almost impossible to get access to a gun Not sure what to do ever time I hear about everything that I will need to do for my future and in the future seems like its way to much effort to even bother I don t want to worry about mortgage and insurance and fucking money and crap I need but couldn t give a crap about But I also don t want to go on the doll because I don t want to be a burden and a disappointment so many conflicting things I just don t know what to do anymore The only reason I live is because others need me but living is becoming too much effort but every time I even think about it all i can think of is my best friend in tears ,0

For the past 5 years I ve encountered multiple near death experiences because of my undiagnosed mental health problems I ve tried talking to my parents but they brush it off by telling me I don t deserve to feel sad because there wouldn t be any reason to I completely understand about what they mean but I can t seem to find any happiness in anything I do despite years of trying The voices in my head tell me I m a piece of shit that should go die but I m scared of what killing myself would do to my family I wish I could get at least a diagnoses of my mental state but the money I ve saved can t cover the sessions And I don t want to trouble my family by asking them for money ,0

Thought I d write a book not a half ass reddit postI ve unsuccessfully attempted too many times to count Thought being caught in the act were signs that I needed to live However I ve come to the ultimate conclusion that my soul is far too tormented to the extent that it also torments others unknowingly Genuinely had so much to teach this fragile world I hope to be remembered like the warm embrace of the sun on a cold winter s day My love and friends I won t be a waste if you learn from me Pay attention to your dreams,0

Hi all I hope everyone s doing the best they can I ve struggled with my depression and anxiety as long as I can remember I ve only been diagnosed for roughly 6 7 years but I ve been on and off with counselling etc for 14 years I haven t had a counsellor for the last 4 years because the one I really meshed with moved and I struggle to build new connections I m on medications that really help but every now and again I just fall apart I mean I still go to work and pay my bills because I know if I don t do that it will make it worse but it s so hard I don t want to up my dosage because I m pretty good for like 10 months out of the year but when it hits me it hits me hard and I cut myself off from everyone they understand and I completely shut down all I do is go to work and fake being okay but even after an hour shift I m completely exhausted from pretending I also find I get anxious over the smallest things Is this just something everyone deals with or do I need to seek more help ,0
I read the posts here and just break down I don t know why I keep coming back it s like a car crash You can t look away but you know it s going to be awful I feel so bad for everyone who s posted here And the worst part is that I see people justifying why they re commuting suicide and what s worse is that I end up thinking that they have a point I find it depressing how closely I ve related to some of these posts but I can t stop coming back,0
I feel unreal today Like something is fundamentally broken in ways that have no solution It s different than my regular depression and anxiety Scary ,0
Recently i seem to be having brain fogs as in i am not able to concentrate in classes nor am i able to take new information as i used to I dont have motivation to do anything The other thing is that whenever i try to make a point a lump forms in my throat and eventually i start crying regardless of whether i made my point or not I also feel really irritated most of the time and i really have no reason to be irritated at those things My parents just tell its nothing and if you continue studying itll pass ,0
I want to die but I m terrified of death I tried to do it 13 years ago I stopped midway through because I got so scared more like terrorized Things got much better since then but there s not a day that goes by without thinking about doing it again Whatever you might say I cant shake off the feeling It s always been there I appreciate all the nice things you want to say but they won t help I just want to know how to live with it without beating myself up everyday ,0
Slowly falling into suicidal thoughtsI have been feeling suicidal for a couple of years to be honest Even though I have gotten help at high school life is shit There s no joy or satisfaction in anything I do not even at home where I m supposed to feel safe All I ve ever done is annoy people it s obvious they all despise me they just don t say it My last school year especially was AWFUL and the start of the shitty GCSEs I have a terrible feeling that I ll either kill myself or just leave everything behind and leave my family and friends What are they going to care This is mainly because of school as well which has given me SEVERE social anxiety and just no self esteem or confidence I ve just given up on believing in myself and probably will do something to myself in a few months ,0
I m sick and tired of people just leaving me in the dust I try so hard to be the best person I can but it s never good enough for anyone I have no point in being here because I m not good enough for anyone or anytbing I need to kill myself so badly but I can t work up the courage to go thru with it I m going to buy a glock and hopefully it will be easier to just pull a trigger then hangibg yourself,0
What s it mean when two separate psych doctors agree that Suicide is a valid option for you One after working with me considered it for himself as well The other said in a way she won t go to jail but still clear enough she thought it was probably the right choice Cuz no one I ever met really got a good defense then oh they shouldn t say that well if they are willing to commute career sepuku and risk life imprisonments over it for someone they have a business relationship and otherwise fully stable and have decade plus time practitioning They must know something No one risks their own career and life for something their soul isn t ok with and not a stranger unless they know they are right or certain about their decision I Think we are so wrong about being so anti suicide because let s be honest There s no real evidence it s wrong that can stand logic,0
It s sad we have to take meds just to function in modern world and we are the ones with problems,0
I just want to give everyone a Mery Christmas I know Christmas can be extra hard sometimes hearing about people spending time together spending time with family The true Christmas feeling I Just want everyone to know that a perfect Christmas doesn t have to be with someone or family do what you like Do you want to be alone on Christmas and have fun by yourself Do that Nobody is going to stop you be proud of who you are I know that being loved is great but there is nothing more important then loving yourself ,0

That s the worst I tried to tell them about my huge mental struggle At first they were a bit supportive but after a while they told me to stop complaining and get my shit together I remember the day when I tried to tell my mum how deeply unsatisfied I am and she stopped me with Enough complaining Just do sthg about it Well after that their impression is that things got better I moved back to the dorm so they don t see me often They sincerely think I solved my problems However the reality could t be more different I am totally losing it and planning my suicide In one moment I am researching for suicide methods and in the other my mom calls and I respond with the lies I have prepared how university is better how my job is better how I feel okay And this is the worst feeling Lying to my parents all the time On the other hand I can t tell them the truth they are fed up with it and have no means to help me They would t understand ,0

Coming back to this subreddit after being a year and a half awayHello everyone I used to be a regular redditor here a while back but about a year and a half I moved out discovered weed and tried to convince myself everything was now fine and that I was no longer suicidal depressed Now ive found myself being depressed for a while and trying to cover it up simply because it s not as bad as it was before I m drinking and chain smoking tonight but writing this as a tribute to all my brothers and sisters on this sub make sure you don t run away from you problems and ignore your depression like I did because it catches up to you ,0
My noose keeps me calm I guess it s the knowledge that eternal peace is nearby for when I decide it s time ,0

I m pretty sure browsing the web and playing video games was a way for me to cope with unpleasant feelings Now since this option is gone I m beginning to feel really depressed and I m trying to find an outlet for this somehow ,0
I don t want to grow oldIf i won t commit suicide now it will eventually happen in the future I find being old boring and sad I feel like no one cares about old people unless they are family The physical pains that will come with it and seeing your loved ones dying one by one is not something i want I don t want to lose my hair get wrinkles and be creepy The point of this isn t to insult old people I would just know if anyone feels the same way ,0
Yeah these could be my thoughts too so I completely get it I feel like I need support outside of therapy appointment but there s no where to go ,0
People are fucking jerks but they re the reason I m sorta sticking around for bit longer I hate all of the people I know Every place I go everybody sucks They all treat me like a second class person a nobody someone who doesn t deserve the second thought But if I go down they are all going to be like He was such a kind person like bitch shut the fuck up you don t care about me you little shit That s right I m not ending it all cuz I m a petty little bitch who doesn t want to give the people their satisfaction ,0

Why does this happen over and overLife gets better I have hope for a few weeks and everything goes down again it s been like this since forever I can t believe this is me being unlucky or whatever Maybe this life is my punishment for something that would also explain why I was never able to kill myself I dont know anymore ,0
I m praying it finally works this timeI ve had so many failed attempts Please let this time be THE time I m done I m done I m done I m done I have depression anxiety borderline personality disorder and ADHD I m a drug addict I only have 2 friends and they both live hours and hours away I know this will hurt them but not nearly as much as I m hurting right now I just NEED the pain to end I ll do anything ,0

I ve made a list of the pros and cons of me ending my life and the cons heavily outweigh the pros However I m having an extremely difficult time today I ve been crying all day and I just feel so tired of everything I know that I can t give up now but the idea is so tempting I m contemplating calling the suicide hotline but I m not even sure what I would say I ve struggled with mental health my entire life But honestly I don t get these suicidal thoughts and temptations that much So when I do it feels like a very good idea Which makes me very worried I m not sure what I m asking for I guess to everyone reading this this stuff is so hard I hope we all end up okay I don t know what else to say I hope we all find a reason to not do it ,0
I think rejection hurts me more than it should Even just thinking about being rejection even when nothing has happened gives me a burning urge to self harm or attempt suicide I think part of the problem is that I ve only experienced rejection when it comes to intimacy and this has warped my perspective I think having a positive experience where i m accepted would be the best solution but that seems like a longshot Is there anything I can do to make myself less vulnerable ,0

I need to know how I can helpMy girlfriend has been battling depression and self harming habits for months now and she s attempted suicide more than once She s been admitted to the hospital for her problems and when she s there her optimism rises but when she gets out it seems to just drain away She s struggling to find enjoyment in things she does and the fact that she doesn t feel like much of anything is helping her just drags her down further I do my best to be supportive and be there for her when she needs me I ll suggest things she might try or people to talk to but a lot of the time it feels like I m not saying anything that useful I m terrified at the thought of losing her and I want to do anything I can to help her get better I just feel like I m not learning anything about her problems and I m confused as to what I should do to help her I need to know what I can do to help her get back on her feet and motivated again Something to lift her from the depressed mind set ,0

Why are the so called counselors on the suicide hotlines always so shitty I swear I ve called them several times and every single time I have a bad experience They re stone cold unknowledgeable sound bored and zoned out all the time with their robotic sounding voices and tones and are just plain unhelpful In fact most of the time it sounds like they re not even trying to help or at least don t want to be talking to me Once I mentioned to one of them how I couldn t afford hospitalization and didn t expect any real help in my area so she asked ME where I was supposed to get help I don t know how it is with others but I ve known nothing but shitty counselors on those lines ,0

I ve officially hit rock bottom Not only a few days ago did I ask a girl out and to my surprise she said yes to it only to ghost me and never respond when I tried to follow up and see where to pick her up at on the day of and not only today did I get rejected badly by a girl I approached when I was out shopping but then I come home as well to my safe haven of sorrow and opened snap and saw I had a few new adds so I snapped them and every single one left me on open that s not even the worst part two of them blocked me right away another one unadded and the other 2 or 3 just didn t respond after they left me on open My record is uncountable atp with the amount of losses I ve took it maybe somewhere between 0 450 or 0 500 the only consistency is the amount of wins being zero The way it looks being an 18 year old guy not having a single positive experience with the opposite sex that I could look back on and smile when I think bout it seems like im jus gonna be a lonely virgin for life why man,0

So I ve had issues with depression in the past But even when I m not depressed I constantly think about ending my life I won t deny that depression makes it more attractive though Right now I have been constantly contemplating it for over a year and have everything required for my method of choice There are certain things that block my actual plan mostly the fact the I had just gotten into a relationship after these thoughts got to this point and now making sure my finances are in order so I don t burden those that would be affected However work is now becoming unbearable and my finances are almost in order I m thinking the time might be right I am not asking for sympathy empathy attention or anyone to talk me down I simply needed to vent to someone that has no emotional investment in my life or lack thereof Thanks Please don t reply If you do any things get better or bs like that is not wanted or needed If I don t care what loved ones think about my choice why would I listen to a stranger Lol ,0

Newsflash Suicide Hotlines don t work for the clinically depressed Sure they re great if you had some trauma or are just feeling overwhelmed Sometimes you just need someone to listen to you and these are great tools for that But if the person on the other end of that line isn t a PhD certified psychiatrist there s not a damn thing they can do if you have depression They aren t equipped to deal with the issue of your own mind telling you you re worthless or the fact that you can t keep a job because you literally can t get yourself out of bed in the morning or that every little thing that happens you blame on yourself What are they gonna do Tell you to stop it Tell you it sucks Tell you to see a professional that costs hundreds of dollars per session Yeah super helpful Half of the population here in America doesn t even believe in it And the other half will charge you an insane amount to deal with it Then there s some who are both ,0

VI Seconds Etika Hello there I have decided to share this song with you guys I believe it is visceral and can help a person when they ve entered into a bad episode Depression and self termination are very serious topics but I do believe it ought to be less stigmatized and discussion should be had more openly as opposed to hushed whispers on grey rainy days When I was experiencing bad days this artist and his songs helped me get through those days just by letting out a lot of the negativity through his own struggles he put to music form I do want to warn you though that this song might be triggering depending on how sensitive you are to ideas of self termination and those stuck feelings we might all experience I hope you all the best ,0

I m so ducking lonelyThe only person I can really trust moved away recently and I m noticing that I m isolating myself from my friends I don t want to do this but I can t stop I m starting to log out of social media just so I can stop seeing that in left on read and see my friends at parties I was invited to but turned down out of shear anxiety and terror that I ll fuck my life up even worse meeting someone who ghosts me I m so scared and tired I want to change but my body doesn t let me I can t sleep I can t think I don t even know if I m consciously thinking anymore or if I m just going through the motions of everyday life Anytime I make an effort to make plans with anyone they always find an excuse I ve never wanted to be with someone as much as I want to stay far away from everyone I m breaking I don t know if I can keep going on like this Can someone please fucking help me out of this I m at my last resort ,0
I m 26m and currently feel like if my life doesn t drastically improve financially socially etc I ll be even more depressed at 30 or 35 however I still have some hope and optimism for marriage kids and having better friends I at least want to give myself a chance to improve my life without even trying or pursuing a career path that s more beneficial I obviously can t ignore economics inflation which will become worse and amplify the thoughts I have but I am extremely frugal just need to tackle making more money so that also gives me hope Has anyone else gone through a similar through process I find that I m more at ease over dying in an airplane or any freak accident because I ve given myself this 5 10 year window This is definitely not the healthiest approach I should still consult a psychiatrist or some formal help but wanted to know if someone has had a similar mindset and ended up living a happy life afterwards Thanks,0

I always wonder why am I so depressed Why do I hate myself so much Who do I always feel like I need to please others because my feelings dont matter I grew up in a religious community I think I relived some part of this in my dream last night All I remember is conformity The fear of embarrassing myself for being different the fear of getting scolded by my parents for embarrassing them My feelings never matter in that situation I don t know what it is like to be worthy of love and compassion because I never receive such unconditional love I always have to be something else that I am not to avoid shame and punishment No wonder I have such a low self worth no bloody wonder that I am suicidal ,0

When I m sober I feel depressed anxious and sad at all times Maybe sometimes I feel a little happiness or excitement on top of it all but it last minutes if not seconds I m currently intoxicated and remembered briefly what I normally feel thus my question When I m drunk or especially drunk AND high weed I feel so much better I m happy in the moment because I simply can t remember what I m not happy about Are there any negatives to being drunk and or high at all times other than while I m working Any reason to be sober I ask only because I can easily manage to be drunk and or high on a very regular basis and I feel better than I have in months ,0

I read the wiki And I ve got a question I don t know why but I feel like a good way to help people is to be perfectly blunt and honest with them No forms of sugaring it up with cliche and lazy phrases including it gets better or please don t do it but I have my own way that I want to know if it s appropriate Something along the lines of a response i might do is below I m not going to tell you that I understand what you re going through or what your life is like I can t promise that your life will get better But just remember if you re thinking about going through with killing yourself just remember that you don t get a second chance no take backs or anything like that Be sure to remember the things that you could lose by going through with it Would suicide solve all of your problems or just create more That s up for you to decide I refuse to encourage either side make your decision in the way you see fit Promise me that you ll make the choice that benefits you and you only ,0

how longhow long would it take for me to die if i cut my wrists does it depend on how deep the cut is a few months ago i tried to kill myself with other method and in my therapy session after my therapist told me about this lady that did this and she died it never leaves my mind I always told myself to not do it this way because i thought i wouldn t work but i m thinking about trying it now,0
Why can t I fucking be happy ever What did I do to deserve this I wish I lived in anime and had a happy life with people who actually liked me I wish I was normal I crave affection like oxygen but the slightest HINT of affection makes me physically sick I hate this I hate this I wish I could press a button to get people to put me out of my misery painlessly I can t wait till I m old enough to go to a country and get euthanised ,0
i think i might be bisexual but i live in a country that is homophobic biphobic transphobic and it scares me i can never come out of the closet for the fear of getting expelled or having no job or any friends i will always be judged or sexualized the fear of becoming a victim of correctional rape scares me i just don t wanna live this way i wanna change it all but there is no way sometimes i wonder if i wasn t born this way things would ve been so better,0
I doubt I m making it to the end of the month I really don t know how else to say that I have a few reasons to live I know I do But the reasons to just give up seems to be an ever growing list My few supports I have all want me to go to emerge and get help but if I have to stay another four weeks in hospital I know that when I get out I ll kill myself the first chance I m out of sight I just can t stand being dead named or called he him by people that I thought where suppose to love me no matter what I can t stand the constant torture of my brain telling me I live in the wrong body that my voice isn t the one that comes out of my mouth that I ll never be the person I was suppose to be I can t handle the constant dreams of how peaceful it will be when I m dead like I m just simply laying back floating in warm water I m so tired I can t wait till I can rest forever ,0
I feel like I m drowning Throat tight shaking hard to breathe The amount of heartbreak is unbearable I ve dealt with so much and I don t know how much longer I can deal with this It honestly feels like a vicious cycle of depression and pain that has no end in sight I thought for sure the last time would be the last but Nothing seems to help I keep trying to fight and better myself but something or someone else always drags me down at my highest I m losing faith My days are numbered and it s only a matter of time before my time runs out and I no longer have the strength or the will to fight Why does it have to be like this ,0
I want to die but not reallyI don t have a compelling reason I just get tired of feeling this I know my family and few friends love me and imagining what they would be through when I m gone makes me sad I don t deserve their love but maybe I want to give them what they deserve Maybe after 2 years I would stop wanting to die Maybe 2 years of enduring my suicidal thoughts is worth it compared to the lifetime of pain my loved ones would have if I disappear ,0

The last two days I ve felt a little burnt out and tired I ve engaged in activities like eating junk watching porn not working playing video games being anti social at work etc Today I am getting back on track To me this means that I will eat healthy drink plenty of water do not engage in porn exercise talk to people brush my teeth and work on my photography business I haven t been taken good enough care of myself and I ve let myself go off the rails Negative thoughts and emotions have crept back in and it s caused me to engage in all those activites that just cause me shame and guilt i need to understand relapsing is apart of the process and that learning from my experience of what went wrong will guide me ,0
Unsure of what to doI really want to die right now I haven t cut in over a year but I think it might be the only thing I can do to stop me from tightening a belt around my neck and the shower curtain I just want this pain to stop and those are the only two ways I see of making myself feel better,0

Forgive me if I m out of line but is it safe to post on here about being an attempted suicide survivor ,0
trying not to kill myselfi feel obsessed my reasons for staying alive have been my roommates and my cats but I literally csnt stop thinking about it like i was driving yesterday and didnt do it bc I remembered that i loved them but i almost drove us right into the middle of oncoming traffic on purpose im sitting here typing this at work right now unable to focus all day just feeling like I want to be dead my mom said drinking sugary lemonaide was going to kill me faster and all I could think was good my stupid little goals list feels meaningless and ridiculous I just feel like I want to die s o bad like I crave it I think im going to call my doctor because im terrified of meds but im sure being numb will at least be nicer for everyone else around me vs me being dead I jsut cant take feeling like this anymore,0

I don t know what to do anymoreI want to apologize in advance for this jumbled wall of text I ve tried to commit suicide twice so far but couldn t bring myself to it My anxiety has gotten to the point where even stepping foot outside is a major struggle I feel like a useless piece of garbage I read somewhere if I remember correctly that you don t want to actually die you just want things to change That s definitely true in my case There are days when I m all fine doing well but then I just spiral down the drain again I ve become numb and alien to my own feelings Most of the time I just want to lie down and stay like that until I die I just typed this out in a sudden urge to somehow get a hold of myself Thank you for reading,0
Do you get worst the longer you live the longer I live the worse I get,0
It never gets better Day in day out the same thoughts surround my head I can t be alone my thoughts hate me I spend my time doing nothing but wishing to vanish from existence Even as I child I never wanted to be here I m not meant for this I shouldn t be here I don t belong People change and grow distant I can t save myself how can they Too much a coward to end things I suffer the pain of existence They all can see it they can t help it It never gets better Im ready to leave It never gets better ,0

Today despite having confronted my mom over the little she s done for me to be happier I forced myself to feel hopeful since another breakdown was not what I wanted Looking through these wholesome subreddits I ve suddenly come upon the thought that the woman I have been helping all this time wouldn t do half not even any of the acts of kindness I see literal strangers do for others An elephant and an ostrich have more of a mutual affectionate relationship than I have with my incredibly self centered mother ,0
I know I post a lot here and don t respond but I do appreciate peoples responses lately I ve just given up on life I do things still but I don t want to bother with people most of the time they just hurt me or make me feel bad my own mum told me how people have it worse and I know it s nothing mean but it hurt so much to hear that I know my life is amazing compared to others but I ain t happy I don t enjoy life or what I do with my life I just feel like none realises what I deal with on a daily basis because of my own mind and it hurts more then anything my mum doesn t want me around anymore really and I don t blame her but she was never there for me when I needed it most and I think that s partly why I m not ok and I don t think she realises it,0

My mental health has been declining lately I feel as though i am doing nothing with my life I have no money and no car so often i just sit at home and work out watch tv or go on tik tok but i have little motivation for anything else Even though i am working out and doing things to improve myself i still have very low self esteem because i can t help but overthink about what people think of me and what i ve done in the past When i hang out with my friends we don t do much and it s always the same boring activities I drink and i smoke so i can be happier and not think about life I m not suicidal but i just feel like i am stuck in a rut and i hate being alone what are things i can do in order to feel happier and more confident in myself as well as things i can look forward to in life so i don t feel so stuck ,0

The irony on my lifeSorry for any english mistakes it is not my native language Anyway When I was a little kid my life was pretty bad already but I never thought suicide was the answer I didn t understand why people would kill themselves I had hope in a better future I had hope that things would get better But they didn t they only got worse My horrible childhood never left my mind My completely dysfunctional family aggravated their dysfunctionality Chronic incurable physical ilness struck me leaving me in pain every single day for the rest of my life My mental health problems aggravated Severe depersonalization OCD I m not even depressed I just feel like I am almost dead inside So there you go The kid who once view suicide as something he would never do now knows it is probably inevitable Not today not tomorrow One day The irony ,0

I just find myself so useless I ve been dealing with social anxiety others may find it easy to go out to work but not for me It s really stressful whenever I think about going out to work Even if I have a job I find it meaningless too to wake up at 7am for a 9am job reaches home at 7pm only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you gotta get up early next day again that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially but that s not working out Now that our breadwinner has passed on we re left with a huge debt for housing loan and also suffering from monthly utilities bills Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family Others look down on me Since I m so useless I m slowly losing my will to live I just want to leave and go to a happier world ,0

I ve fell into a bout of depression that is more severe than I have ever had To be honest I don t know exactly what triggered it but I need help How do you make yourself eat because you know you need to but your body has zero interest Everything I have googled shows easy recipes and low effort foods which is great but I m so scared because I don t feel hungry and food doesn t sound interesting at all I also had covid about 6 months ago and my taste is not at all the same as it used to be so my favorite foods don t stand out like they used to Any advice is appreciated Thank you ,0
it doesn t seem like there s a point to being happy or living at all when things just go back to the sad and lonely default no emotions or feelings at all seems a lot better than even feeling happy because i know the happiness will end its fleeting it s comforting knowing that death means i don t need to feel any more emotions or feelings and that absence of feeling will always be there once i finally do it,0
It will break my beloved parents hearts in two forever They have been the most loving supportive and understanding parents I could ever ask for They hug me feed me take me to treatment and I absolutely adorn them But it s not enough And it s not their fault I suffer from an incurable physical condition and it has gotten to the point where my suffering has outstripped my will to love I have set a date But I know it will break their hearts forever I never ever intend for that to happen I don t think I can forgive myself ,0

I do That gentle warmth That trust where you don t have to live with fear and paranoia Knowing you can reach over for some physical touch and not be rejected or shamed for it Being loved tenderly and feeling protected I miss love That safe kind Not the passionate and extreme kind that burns way too bright and way too quickly I want to be held and know that he wants me That he chooses to be with me That he cares and it s not just about what I can do for him I want to know I m wanted I want to be loved and to love I have so much love to give just not to the wrong person I don t want to be lied to again I don t want to be tricked again I don t want to have my heart pummeled into the ground again I wish I could just live life alone Not want intimacy Not need anyone else But I guess I m only human after all I want to feel the warmth of someone s touch and to feel safe in someone s arms To feel that connection ,0
I relocated for my graduate scheme with my fiance I have no friends here My only 2 best friends live a while away and are busy My university friends take no interest in me and have their own lives now Work makes me anxious and lonely I feel trapped in an endless loop of work home sleep repeat and my life feels pointless with no accomplishments I have my fiance whom i adore but he struggles too with depression so its hard to discuss together I worry we will end up breaking up because of our mental health or because sometimes it just happens but we have a new puppy together a mortgage and are getting married in a few years I don t want to be alone forever and I love him but still the worry keeps me up at night that one day I could wake up and it will all be gone I just think I am too weird or anxious to make friends I feel like a loser and see mutuals posting on socials with their friends all the time makes me wonder why I can t have that No point to the post just a word vomit situation ,0
I know i will die by suicide im fifteen years old and since i was 11 years old all i can think about is which way is the most peaceful way to go The only thing stopping me is goals and ambitions i want to accomplish before dying i dont know what im going to do if these goals aren t achieved but i have to complete them before dying Also the thought of my poor mother walking in on her only sons dead rotting corpse makes me think twice about killing myself But im so tired i just want it all to end i just want to be at peace with the universe and leave this sad pathetic world,0
Guys I m not sure I can do this anymoreI miss my dad too much and the world is in too much of a shitty place Besides I promise no one would care or mourn remember me the ones that would would forget in like a day I m talentless anti social awkward garbage who is constantly berated by his family and his friends Why am I even still here ,0

Someone really changed their life suicidal thoughts through therapy own will etc for longterm I feel like I always get some days I m full of hope and motivation and take the pain but I m almost 30 and it ALWAYS were after a couple of days or weeks I m the old one laying in my bed hating everything etc Always this circle So that the phases where I get motivated and positive get rarer and rarer which results in already knowing I ll be back in my misers whatever I do after some time which makes everything even harder,0
30 years old Father of two one who doesn t see me nor does he care about me The other I care for full time Two years old and perfect in every possible way Partner for 3 going on 4 years Maybe it s a early life crisis or just a wobble But the thoughts of being dead to better those I care about often wanders into my mind By often I mean multiple times a day An extreme feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy not doing enough can t be relied upon not ambitious enough I could go on for hours I can t shift the feeling of my partner looking for an out I m now starting to believe my demise may be that out Deep down I can feel all I truly want is to be wanted Loved unconditionally and intimately I want to be successful and strong in the eyes of those who matter How do you do that when all you know of yourself and what you re constantly reminded of is how inadequate your existing is ,0
 1 I m tired 2 Sleep 1 No You don t understand ,0
No idea where my life is going Feeling depressed everyday Medication is not working and is causing me constipation and making me more irritable Life seems to be upside down Everything annoys me and irritates me But yet at the worst point right now i feel relaxed I think sometimes when we are given too much control of our lives when life is perfect we feel less happy waiting for the next best thing That s for me at least My life is objectively quite shit right now yet i feel as a result of a loss of control of my life safe i feel i can make the best out of every day despite feeling like crap Edit I would like to give some examples Like i feel more grateful for alone time now instead of seeing it as being alone I feel happier now when i can get to eat food without pain i feel grateful for being able to go to the toilet and shit with ease I feel grateful for just being able to fall asleep It s depression that made me realise many things don t come natural to us,0
I think I finally hit that point where I m at ease with dying I have a plan 99 sure it ll work after doing extensive research God if my dad saw my search history yikes I m going to pay off the bill I owe to my grandparents get rid of some of my stuff so my dad don t have to and then I ll just do it My dad his gf are never home I m a adult so it don t matter But I know when I m ready they will be gone for the weekend and I can do it They probably won t find my body for a while because they only come in my room every couple of months I m always at work or sleeping so it doesn t really matter Either way I m at the point where I know I m ready Having it planned out has me a peace which is weird but I guess that s how you know it s your time ,0
Probably overdose,0
i hate me,0
Feeling nothing is better than feeling pain I want it to be done I m looking for a place for it to be over it s not going well i don t have one at least then it could be peace it hurts to never see people again but most will probably be better off without me i keep thinking about my ideas and working them out and it just makes me very sad but okay at the same time at least it would be over ,0

I ve been helping everyone but who is going to help me Hearing the comments they make about depression makes me feel disgusted I thought they would understand how it feels No one seems to care about me I could disappear and no one would notice Why what did I do wrong I just want to be like everyone else I m tired of keeping everything to myself I have no one to talk to It hurts I m sorry I just need to get it out ,0
Once I realized that I became almost fearless I can talk about anything confront anyone I got promotions at work But no new friends A marriage without affection I m 40 and I see no hope I ve never tried killing myself but I wish I was dead every day Whatever happens next the worst case scenario is death by suicide That makes a lot of outcomes that were once unthinkable become a little easier to deal with ,0

I am basically a fraud and a moronSo I accidentally committed fraud yesterday I needed a signature on a document and without thinking I just borrowed it from a document that was basically the same and sent it up One of my coworkers noticed how fast I got everything back so I told her how I missed a signature and borrowed it She told me that it was fraud we quickly contacted the other company and asked them to rescind the document Now I feel so guilty I actually want to kill myself Like I can t stop thinking about it I m not a dumb person but acted like such an idiot just because I wanted to do my job more efficiently This could have consequences for my company or myself or possibly even the person who s signature I carelessly borrowed I can t live with it I either want to kill myself or turn myself in But I m scared if I turn myself in that my company could get in trouble ,0

Posting here bc everyone else will call the cops or tell my parentsI m terrified to even tell my therapist I want to kill my self because I don t want to be imprisoned in a hospital and have all future job prospects ruined with a 51 50 My long term live in boyfriend s really more of a domestic partner mom killed herself 3 years ago so I can t tell him either because he just yells at me and gets upset when I say I want to die and threatens to call my mom or the police I m In my mid twenties have a job but I might lose it in spring bc I was hired specifically as pandemic help I have no other prospects Only reason I might not kill my self is it would make my mom cry and she doesn t deserve it she s a really really good person I have to stop now my eyes are blurring and I can t type anymore,0

Obviously I m not suited for my job I ve only been working at my job for a week and a half I was late to a training session missed a staff meeting and accidentally scheduled myself to work on the days I have night classes Now I need to figure out how to switch shifts for 6 different nights but none of my coworkers are answering my texts My supervisor probably hates me I m not suicidal right now but I m really panicked and feel like another screw up would push me over the edge I m trying really hard not to cry This job was already something I was stressed about because it s something way outside my comfort zone I have an anxiety disorder and social anxiety and this job requires a LOT of socializing and event planning It doesn t help that all of my coworkers seem to be really close already and text and hang out outside of work As always I m the odd one out I ve never fit in or belong anywhere I feel like people just tolerate me And I know this screw up is only going to make everyone see me even more poorly ,0
What sucks the most about being suicidal You know what just fucking sucks the most about being suicidal Being a coward So many fucking times have I felt like the shittiest piece of trash in the world but I just cant end it Its not a question of how much I really want to do it it s a question of why I can t build up the courage and fucking end it Cutting and excessive drinking are too easy but the second I decide tonights the night im done I freeze I just cant do it I envy all the people who built up the courage to end their lives Thats so ballsy ,0
why are you here I usually respond to posts here I really want to help someone But I feel like my motives are mostly selfish Trying to help others is just a way of trying to desperately help myself A part of me wants to be the hero I didn t have when I self harmed as a cry for help a couple years ago Those were unheard cries into a merciless and bottomless void of which only echoes could be heard Honestly I don t know if things are going to get better I m trying I think I don t want to die yet When I can t sleep when I m stuck in dark corners of my mind when I think school feels really useless so I want to do something meaningful I come here What could be more meaningful to me than the possibility of saving a life I m just a wannabe hero I don t know if I ve actually helped anyone here but I want to thank anyone who helps out and replies to posts I don t mean anything in a self congraulatory way I kind of just wanted to appreciate the existence of this subreddit it means a lot to me ,0

Yesterday she texts me that she wants to stop going out and stop going with other people that she wants to be a happy couple again But then later that afternoon she tells me she had sex with another dude the week prior but hasn t touched me or even hugged me in a month and then I look at her phone and see that she s still snapping multiple dudes but she blames it on me because she wants to ease back into the normal thing Even at this moment I m sitting down with her watching a movie but all I hear is her typing and her getting mad Snapchats from dudes but I m an asshole for being upset and acting upset at the fact that she s playing mind games with me and most importantly at the fact that she had sex on a day where she said she was going to hang out with a friend and then go to the gym but she ended up sleeping with a dude and staying the night at his house im tired of being hurt like this tbh,0

Has anyone ever felt like when they are actually feeling well happy and motivated that they get shut down I ve recently switched antidepressants and today was a good day Got a lot of good news fought through a lot of negative self talk to get things done m and made a great dinner and a fun drink to go with it Friend comes home and I m joking around with her being playful and happy and she says that it s too much That I m doing too much This has happened multiple times before and it s just frustrating Does she prefer me when I m depressed When I m in a good mood I get shut down but when someone tells a joke I m not in the mood for I m called insecure and sensitive What s the point of getting better when people get used to you at your worst What s the point of doing the work to get better when it s not recognized and it s so much harder anyway It s so much easier to lay on the couch and do nothing than it is to make a healthy meal show some positive emotion and be social ,0

Well that sounds like a country whose whole structure would fall apart in days But then again there would be no consequences for it because we d all be too depressed to enforce any laws on each other haha ,0
Maybe it can help knowing that it s you that is sad but not your dog This might sound weird but For example recently my father died and I didn t suffer a lot Because he was in deep pain before dying and I actually was relieved that he abandoned that pain for good He is not suffering anymore So could I be more happy for him than to abandon that life of struggle for good In this case your dog probably wasn t suffering or anything like that but it can be insightful realizing that your dog right now is not sharing your pain of his lost Your dog is allright with his death Can you be too I m sure he she wouldn t want you to suffer ,0

I made a point out of reading as many posts I could when I could and reporting both posts and replies that made me feel uncomfortable regarding the scope of this subreddit That said there was never any feedback I understand it s quite feasible that a lot of things I reported may have been deemed acceptable or have been reported multiple times That said however it has lead me to cherry pick posts where I can mostly share my experiences to help a person and ignore comments from others unless in the thread of conversation I understand giving direct feedback all the time is a lot to ask but letting users know that their feedback is received and acknowledged I m not here with a solution but a representation of my predicament ,0

I don t remember the last time I was genuinely happyI was depressed most my life I always kept on living with the mentality of life has ups and downs Sure I could end it stop existing and there are no downs anymore but the only way to experience ups is living I was used to a world full of greyness and numbness but I just realized I don t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy While this alone is depressing enough I was always able to endure it until the next up phase But recently I started to hate myself I don t know if I fit here since I don t have concrete plans of ending it yet but everyday I come closer to the conclusion that enduring life is just not worth it I started therapy and was gonna contact a doctor for medication but is a life you are only able to endure because you are on drugs everyday really worth it Thanks for listening to my rant ,0

I m not sure if I m posting here as a sort of I finally reached peace or a wait maybe this is actually a bad idea I know that killing myself isn t the ultimate solution But the consequences of my actions are so severe that I can t and don t want to go through life with them There is no way out of what I did see previous post if curious I have set a date I know my method I have arranged for the deliveries and the place I m a doctor like a fully licensed doctor with prescription powers I have thought of thousands of combinations of medications that could kill me But I have decided against pills Too risky Anyway I won t discuss the method of my choosing But I know it is painless It s all I really want from it It s not the suffering I want to get away from it s the reflex of my body to stop that suffering that will stop my progress This way I ll just fall asleep ,0

I Hate Leaning on PeopleI like to think I love people They interest me in many ways including myself since I m one of them However it really drains me the idea that I m leaning on others too much There s no other way to put it I have no idea how far I should be at this point in life or how independent except that most people my age are married and or working Recently this leaning on others thing has become more of an issue because as I get older everyone seems to expect more independence of me and I get insecure and hide in my room instead of being there and talking because I m worried they ll make some snarky but sincere comment that I m not working hard enough or that I m a freeloader I loathe that word It really does make me feel suicidal at times Like I would rather be anywhere but there The shame So what can I do to feel less guilty for leaning on other people Maybe I should buy my family a gift like champagne or something ,0

When dying is all thats left I have had suicidal thoughts now for longer than I can remember Its something I ve had for years probably decades The thought of ending it all has never been far away from my conscious mind and for that reason I ve sorted accepted it like a shadow In the last few months these thoughts have become more pronounced to the extent that I m now planning the how and the when where before it was just the general thought of ending it I m not sure whether I will would act but I feel I m being pulled closer towards ending my life I ve rationalised the impact this would have on other people to the extent I don t care what I d be leaving behind anymore I m not sad tearful or outwardly depressed I just feel permanently tired of life that I ve given it a shot and its not for me ,0

I know for a fact that I have some form of depression But all of my reasons for being feeling depressed sound so silly to me that it stops me from asking my Mum if I can see a doctor to properly diagnose me They all sound so stupid which always leads me to regret the fact that I use a suicide prevention line Some of the questions that I ask myself are like Why would you tell this stranger Why are you such a fucking wimp Why I normally end up screaming internally inside my bed I used to cry myself to sleep but now there aren t any tears left I sing myself songs of my childhood And I m very surprised that A nobody has noticed yet and B I m not in a mental hospital ,0

I had a dream a year ago about me killing myselfA year ago I dreamt that I shot myself it was so vivid It was a lot like the scene in Fight Club with the narrator Lately I ve been having the dream again and again I remember the details the sounds everything I ve had some things happen lately where I just feel like giving up I feel terrible some days are better than others but I just don t want to be here anymore I just don t want to feel like this anymore I wish I could go back in time I wont do it but I keep having thoughts ,0
The past week or two things have just been going down hill mentally for me I m not in a good place at all and I know that I ve given up on everything I think at this point I quit work I don t know if I can carry on with everything life brings it s so hard to cope I don t want to lose my girlfriend I know she isn t the best for me but sometimes I feel good when she actually pays attention to me and I need something decent in my life even if ain t the best I just don t think I can keep her and if that s the case I m only going to get worse I just need some advice,0
i see no point in living everyday is just constant anger and sadness all i do is get yelled at everyday for what i did do or what i didn t do i never get a break i get judged for everything i do wear say everything i m so sick of this imo life is stupid and useless and we would all save ourselves a lot of pain if we just ended it if i knew an easy way to kms i definitely wouldn t be here i hate being alive and living in this constant pain,0

Title is basically this we were together for almost 7 years which is almost a third of my life She was my first and only love and I don t want to find anyone else becaue I only ever loved her Life is hollow and meaningless now Everything I worked for for the both of us it doesn t matter any more unless I can share it with her,0
Sometimes I think this is a simulation One that I ve been on for many lives and for this one I have selected expert as my level of difficulty Sometimes I just want to press the reset button I don t want to not be alive I just don t want to live this specific life it truly is difficult If I was certain that I would reenter this world I d press the reset button in a heartbeat But I m not and I don t want to throw my lifetime away I do believe there is a way out of feeling like life is meaningless For a while now I have not been able to feel my feelings for anyone or anything Everything is bland I feel stuck I m not going to be very detailed about my situation but a good analogy is you need food water and oxygen but no matter where you go you only get 2 of the 3 That s not a good way to live but sadly a lot of people live feeling similar to this Anyways I hope things get better for you guys I ll be alright we ll be alright we just gotta keep our eyes on a new prize ,0

My only current friend is clearly depressed and they feel like they just want to f ing die and i don t know what to do or say about it I met them on Discord in late February and especially recently they ve seemed very depressed because of all the pressure from showing that they re doing better to the people around them and possibly because their parents almost disowned them for being asexual non binary I think they also feel like no one cares about them except for me cause i just told them that i do care a lot about them I live in the Netherlands but they live in Ukraine so we can t speak in person only over text Discord calls They also said today that they appreciate my help ,0

All I can think about is what it would be like if I had taken chances What if I took sports when I was younger instead of reading all day I sure as hell wanted to What if I actually practiced guitar instead of sitting around listening to music Would I be able to play my favorite songs What if I wasn t so weird when I was a kid Would I not be alone right now if I were a normal kid What if I talked to that one girl Would I have found a friend What if I wasn t raised in this crappy town What if the gun went off during the early morning hours of 6 20 17 Where would I be Now all I can think about is trying again I m sorry for rambling I just need someone to talk to who will understand ,0

I moved to the States while there was a war occurring in my country I moved the the States with my son to get a job and be financially stable before insisting my wife and 2 daughters on moving to the States with me They were supposed to be on board a ship that was headed for the States but I waited on the docks for hours to see my wife and daughters But their ship never docked My excitement to see my wife and daughters slowly turned to worry as I was informed that their ship was attacked by pirates from another country I sometimes question to myself if I should ve taken them with me on the day that I left ,0

Hypocrisy in the argument against catching the busThe argument of people that say u shouldn t kill yourself you will create devastating sadness A sadness so profound that we I will never get over dont feel bad because we will feel bad so ultimately behind all the veils of caring for the other person all they fucking care about is avoiding pain and discomfort themselves So I should live with devastating sadness I should have the ability to respond and make myself happy Why dont you turn that standard upon yourself and take responsibility for your own emotions and just snap out of it just be happy turn that from upside down no matter if your loved ones kills themselves No way because their standards are double standards Goddamn hypocrites I would love an explanation to the contrary ,0

Hate my job and career choice and despite wanting to write I can t bring myself to do it since it ll suck anyway I just don t have the mental fortitude or skills both to withstand what obstacles lie in life or to do what I want I have no ambitions or deep desires All I ever wanted was to live in peace but I know I ll be stuck in this place forever and the desire to end this pain is constant It s so constant that I can t bring myself to stop it since it s a part of me an affirmation of myself I don t know how much longer I m going to survive ,0
I have to agree with this I know that people mean well but sometimes it s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him her happier I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts It s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that Sorry for my rambling That s my two cents on the topic ,0
I don t know what s going on in my life everything is really confusing I know what I want to do but nothing I do to achieve it works I know that it is a matter of time dedication and perseverance besides that nothing comes overnight but it has been 7 years and I do not see a single result In all that time only bad things happen and I feel that it s no longer worth fighting for a dream that may not be for me ,0

i feel super frustrated because on a purely rational logical level i know what i have to do to improve my mental health like for example being more compassionate towards myself seeking out help from therapists and doctors opening up to people around me etc but even thinking about doing any of those things feels incredibly daunting and unattainable like something i will never be able to do i know that i probably have to divide any task into micro tasks which then somehow become more manageable but even that in it self seems so far out of my current capacity planning stuff etc does anyone feel the same has anyone advice or is the only way out of it to just do it in a brute force kinda way x200B any input is highly apprechiated and much love to y all 3,0

If I end up lying down in my bed for the majority of the day sometimes I think about how small I am compared to space There are billions and billions of galaxies There are a whole heck of a lot of stars in space out there too Compared to me space is too large So who cares about a tiny human like me I ve got a finite number of years to spend yet I m spending every waking moment not having enough energy to move Strangely enough the thought of things that matter much more than my life motivates me to move and do things sometimes Nothing really matters so why shouldn t I get up for once ,0

Hello beautiful people I might try on mondayI was recently trying to hang myself but the rope ended up being too elastic and I standed on the floor while being choked I m quite sleepy and relaxed I don t feel emotional Why do I want to try again I don t want to participate in this life anymore I m not fond of going to school in this body cleaning cooking socializing I have no reason to do these things I m dead meat for myself since my first attempt The hatred eaten it s way through me it s too late Years too late My family members could actually miss me I thought about it But what does it change if they can t treat me like a human when I m alive I won t think about mourning while being 6 feet in the dirt I had plans for my life not so long ago but I got a conclusion that I should wait for a better body to host If that s possible if not I m not even mad ,0

Peer support is great but only to a certain point Most personality disorders Major depression and GAD to name only a few won t recieve any benefit from treatment without a clinician and intensive therapy,0
I want to kill myself but i cant and I don t have the strength to tell anyone who would miss me that I want to die I don t want to seek help because therapy and medicine are so expensive and I have no money and the money I make should go to pay off my loans I m going to owe and I have trouble getting into my career path but switching takes so much effort and mental energy that I just don t have I don t know what to do anymore I know crying every day doesn t do anything to remedy any situation or help but I just don t know what to do I m so scared of myself and these thoughts I keep having,0
Hey guys I have been very recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety I have been struggling with problems for around 1 5 year and only now it came to light that it is psychologically not physical With my state worsening severely in last 2 3 months I have noticed something When I get the attack I have problems with speech I talk slowly struggle with saying pronouncing certain words letters Can anxiety depression cause this during the attack I have found that this happens to people with a stroke but I haven t had a stroke all medial tests were negative Thank you all for any kind of advice if not allowed I will delete this post ,0

I have an opportunity to kill myself in a few days I have to get surgery in a few days and will need to be put to sleep by anesthesia Apparently there are things you can do before getting put under that can make sure you do not wake up It happened to someone in my family IMO that sounds like a peaceful and painless way to go especially for someone like me who just wants to disappear I really don t know anything about anesthesia and am going to look into it more I am tired of living and hate myself I have no friends even though at one point I had lots I ve never been the same since my concussion and I no longer see a point to continue living especially since my life has been downhill since then and keeps going downhill I think God wants me to stop existing I am convinced he is real since that s the only explanation for why I have been punished so much these last 6 years Funny thing is ive kept it all to myself for all these years Never told a single soul until now ,0

Since age 10 or so I ve never had a friend that cared about me only those shitty ass school friends whose only activity was to play fucking boring and dumb video games My whole teen life was thrown away with sitting in front of a rectangle screen and wasting life Now I realized that life brings joy with good friends and meeting each other Fuck man I ve never experienced that Everytime I go to the city I see groups of people and then theres me awkwardly going alone through the streets Of course there s my older brother who has a good paying job a wife good friends and he even moved 3 times already And there is me 18 years old finished highschool and I m scared of job life In 4 days I should be applied to studying something and I know that I can t do it Of course I got bullied in secondary school and since then I didn t even know what the word social meant This shouldn t even be such a long text but I felt like ranting today I hope someone can relate c,0

I m broken I have dx adhd and depression I take adhd medication I m probably also on the autism spectrum but I don t have the money to figure that out I m an intelligent being that can t actuate potential and get through the mental roadblocks everywhere and explaining that to someone just leads to them thinking I m lazy If being so mentally broken that you can t do some basic things is laziness then yes I m lazy I m not really suicidal in the way that like I don t enjoy life I do when not thinking about work financials More in like a I feel like such a useless member of our capitalist society maybe it would be better for everyone if I was just gone I just can t seem to earn my stay and obviously that s important I m currently barely scraping to get unemployment with the help of my parents since I m unable to do it myself ,0

this is more of a question than anything often times once I find things going well in life I sit down and remember where I was months ago times where I ve been severely depressed and for some reason miss it it s an awful feelings once you re experiencing it but for some reason I get this weird attachment to the feeling I ll be happy and growing as a person but then get the urge to just self sabotage and send myself back to the hopeless place I once was in before I feel like since ive viewed myself as someone who is mentally ill and depressed ever since elementary school it s almost become an ingrained part of who I am as a person so leaving that state feels weird does anyone relate to this I m not sure if the way I worded it quite captured the feeling,0

QuestionWould you consider being called a parents worst nightmare verbally abusive ,0
I had a vivid nightmare last night of killing myself This nightmare was very strong It detailed me using a method with a moderately high success rate and that I had easy access to In the dream it was late at night I attempted it in the dorm bathroom I felt psychosomatic pain from the violent nature of the method And that pain lasted for a few minutes after I woke up So I m afraid I m afraid that I will actually attempt My dream showed me just how easy it would be It showed me how much it would physically hurt so I might be numb to the pain if I actually tried And it messed me up enough so as to make going through today so much harder giving me a stronger feeling of having nothing left ,0

As a support tactic that will usually turn out to worse than useless Basically you re asking somebody who s probably in so much pain that their cognition is severely compromised to engage in a thought experiement The likely results of this are The insensitivity of a response that shows a complete misunderstanding of their experience will likely escalate their sense of alienation That is one of the two most critical factors linked to suicidal intent Their inability to feel better after receiving this kind of help will likely increase their sense of failure and unworthiness which is the other top critical factor linked to suicidal intent Besides all that your basic premise seems to be that contemplating the finality of death would be a deterrent Sorry but the kindest way I can describe that is plain stupid If you ve lost your connection to your survival instinct the finality of death is an inducement ,0
No triggers no nothing I just feel like crap again ,0
Personally I never felt loved Not from anyone I don t understand why people treat the parent child bond as a beautiful strong bond I really tried to understand but I can t see why I have a terrible connection with my family It s a major reason for my suicidal behaviour and mental issues For me I m just a project they are investing on A failing non profitable project A meaningless investment nothing more It s better for them if don t exist At least they re gonna save some resources My existence doesn t mean shit Feeling abandoned and lost better to leave it Dying is better than marching towards suffering while being a weak person ,0

Things were so bad plus unknowingly being bipolar I started brainstorming and researching ways to suicide The painless methods were inaccessible to me so in the end I went with hanging So I hung to suffocate which was horrible and as if an angel had told her she found me and cut the rope I survived and they took me to psych treatment Then the psychiatry diagnosed me bipolar and prescribed me some meds for bipolar yeah Sometimes they work sometimes not and I began having panic attacks Right now I m sad for whatever reason of being bipolar and was thinking about suicide So I began writing about all this instead of planning suicide Do I care or don t I care about myself Sometimes I m unlucky but I am now lucky I have a best friend who s a great and so adorable person I want to answer but I have been panicking getting depressed and things going wrong in general Regardless I ll answer because I ll get better ,0

I was already sad and depressed and didn t have much hope I met this guy online we chatted for 3 months talking on calls for hours every night I never took the first steps made sure didnt invade his space and all that he would make me feel so special he made future plans with me marriage and kids and said he wants to meet me as soon as he can then he just disappeared ghosted me its been 2 weeks i have decided to move on now but its so so heartbreaking he could have at least said bye My trust issues have increased so much and i dont know if I d be able to trust anyone now We were really close and he just left me like that We are both adults i am 25 he is in his early 30s I have had really bad anxiety and i had to make myself sleep through sleeping pills i know it may seem like just a heart break and maybe it is but it feels like some family left me I just wanted to share this,0
I wish I wasn t born to be honestMy dad does crystal meth and in the past did it in front of me He cares about me and I know he loves me but I feel like I can t live a normal life because I live with him It s hard because when he is sober he is kind but when he s on drugs or coming off of them he acts very crazy and at times inappropriate I also feel guilty for disliking him because he provides food shelter and has always worked but I feel like he really just wasn t fit to be a parent Yesterday I cried about it and my mom told me I was being crazy and that I need to grow up I honestly just wish I could kill myself because I don t know how to deal with this situation and I feel I wouldn t be able to live on my own because I can t afford it and I have no life skills ,0
I finally came up with the perfect plan It is perfectly legal and extremely easy to do It is very effective as well I m happy that my research into methods was worth it The best part of my method is that there is very little survival instinct holding me back I am really excited for when I will be able to carry it out ,0
It seems I m in a cycleStage 1 Mostly happy energetic exercising regularly lasts from a day to a week Stage 2 Decrease in mood weird feelings very hormonal lasts from an hour to about 3 days Stage 3 Depressed but not suicidal non energetic and tired sleeping habits worsen anywhere from a day to weeks at a time Stage 4 Suicidal Constant suicidal thoughts and tendencies No motivation which leads to not doing work or chores and feeling worse Stage 5 basically just stage 3 again Then it repeats ,0

Girl showed me cuts on her arms and said she wasn t gonna do it should I trust her So there s this girl at my school who s often lonely maybe has two friends she s almost always alone at lunch and stuff I have tried being friends with her once I realized she was lonely but we never really hit it off Today she asked if she could ask a quick question which I replied Sure She said Be honest what do these look like as she showed me faded cuts on her arm I said suicidal cuts because this is a serious matter and I didn t want to lay her off with an I don t know or cat scratches She said I was right but she wasn t going to kill herself I kept asking Are you sure repetitively but she kept respond with I m sure Deep down inside I don t think she ll do it and I hope she won t but I m not sure Should I trust her ,0

People do go into psychology because they have issues and those people are probably more sincere The problem is therapy isn t set up to be an emergency service I ve had therapists have gone above and beyond for me in different ways and I m very lucky to have had that but if you are in crisis you need out or inpatient care Not saying it s easy to find a good program for either of these you re more likely than not unable to afford a really good outpatient inpatient program But from a therapist daughter insider most therapists don t make much money at all and your insurance company if you have one will find any tiny reason not to pay for your session so my mom has had to put in claims more than once and it s a regular event for her just not to get paid for some sessions And our family was anything but well adjusted My brother was a drug addict and I have Asperger s Bipolar2 was psychotic for three years in 8th 11th grade and Anxiety Binge eating problems and PCOS Our family dealt deals with more than most ,0

I hope you find something that works for you my friend I wish you the best zzzzz s,0
I had no idea about that this should be also fixed on suicidewatch sometimes I ask people to pm not because I want to feel close to them but because sometimes the person isn t using a thrwoaway and don t wanna give too much details in public Anyway this rule makes a lot of sense ,0

Practically every day I see posts on social media from those looking for their answers to this and very similar questions many from the context of having done a great deal of reflection through the Covid crisis and now as we hopefully begin to emerge in to a new and changed reality Wellbeing psychology and the solution focused approach have a huge amount to offer in this respect and I m currently considering the feasibility of PERMA Hypnotherapy offering a program to meet this end combining the best from these areas to give a structured approach and an outcome that is a clear understanding of this is what I am this is what my life is about here is what I am going to do and why and this is my legacy to the world It would be interesting to hear if there is a demand for such a program and if so what specifically would you like to see ,0
Honestly no matter what I do or how I feel I just feel so ugly inside and it doesn t matter how many times I go to the gym to feel better to look better I just have this inner hatred for myself I hate people I m at the same time it s nice to meet someone that at least understands you I don t know maybe I m meant to be alone,0

i m 19 i know i m young but just so much shit has happened and nothing i m dealing with is temporary and got a bunch of pills and idk what else to do,0
for some context i m 19 work in a trade and experienced some dark shit when i was 11 no one in my household or work believes mental health is a big deal while i have friends only one of them is close enough to confide in and most of them are currently on a night out i wasn t invited to this is the lowest i ve felt in years i ve just accidentally insulted my closest friend to the point she won t talk to me after she texted me during a slump and i snapped at her yes i apologised very sincerely the guilt of upsetting her on top of the state i was already in has pushed me to tears for the first time in 2 years and i m not sure how i ll cope without being able to vent somewhere idk if any of this is normal and i m terrified that my mental state has deteriorated this badly recently so thank you if you ve read this even if you don t respond ,0
I rather live in a dream until I inevitably expire never ending and it s all ultimately meaningless regardless So the farther I distance myself from it all the better I can t even force myself to care anymore It really does feel like I wasn t meant for this world Like nothing ever mattered and all I could do was run away from the emptiness of knowing the fact I live to distract myself,0

I don t know which is stupider why I wanna do this or why I don tHow stupid is if that the main reasons that are stopping me from going through with this are that I m scared I m general of not being alive and I m scared of what people might think Lol how pathetic is that ,0

I hate my current situation of burnout And I can confidently say I hate my job and that I want to leave But I need the money and job hunting is not exactly an easy process I took a day off yesterday but this morning I woke up with anxiety thinking about work I wonder if mental health or burnout is somehow covered in leave of absences like FMLA or short term disability But I have never been to a psychiatrist I just feel really upset and I keep getting flares of anger and anxiety from work right now I have been wanting to quit everyday for the last two weeks and somewhat comfortably expressing to friends and family how I hate my job Literally ,0
Well almost choked myself out Since this house is crumbling and i doubt even the shower rod could hold my weight 120lbs i went head and tried to essentially strangle myself using some rope and our bathroom door I managed to just chill for a few minutes but i guess feeling like my face is swelling is too much for my bitch ass to handle I have no real reason to stick around anyway i cant stand being a burden ,0

My final try tho I m still depressed I stopped to a new low On Saturday night I took 15g of aspirin in one sitting and went to bed next to my partner whom I love with my entire heart and went to bed hoping I ll die in my sleep I woke up in the morning partially deaf nauseous lightheaded and sick to my stomach about what I had just done I rushed to the ER with her I was driving where I was placed in the ICU almost immediately ended up staying 2 nights and 3 days in the hospital they took various blood tests were worried about internal bleeding brain swelling and etc I denied suicide attempts there to avoid the psych ward I said I took it for a headache And my lovely girlfriend was going through this so hard it hit her so hard even though she didn t know about the attempt I m heartbroken but I ll never attempt again ,0

GuiltI wish I could just erase myself from people s memories so I could kill myself and not hurt anyone Really the guilt of hurting people left behind is the only reason I haven t offed myself yet ,0
FebruaryI tried killing myself this past February I told a lot of people and they either didn t really know how to react or didn t really care Not much has changed since then I ve felt very few times where im happy to be alive and more often than not I experience things and just think man this is what i stayed alive for is it even worth it I keep trying to fix whats wrong and i keep failing Ive failed for so many years idk how much longer i can keep going,0
I ll never be good enoughWhat the hell is so offputting about me that I have no one in my life who actually cares about me loves me i have people who i love and care about but they don t give a shit about me and I m tired of putting so much effort into people I know Don t appreciate or give a shit about it also feel like I ruined it with the guy I like even though we still talk I just feel like he s the same as all the rest and doesn t really care about me either and honestly if I were these people I would just stop talking to me all together because what s the point I have nothing to offer Not attractive socially awkward etc Why should I live this cruel life just to die a cruel death anyway I think imma just get it the hell over with and do a favor for everyone that I know ,0
Hopefully once you start to feel better things will change Having a animal companion helps tremendously,0
Looking for things for my friend who is depressed to doMy friend is only 12 he doesn t have access to video games or stuff like that His mind keeps wandering due to reasons and I need something for him to do that requires a lot of concentration to where his mind won t wander so he won t worry or be to depressed Suggestions He doesn t really like movies tv shows unless thier like twilight zone,0

i dont know what the point is attention maybe to vent either ways nothing good comes out of it i m still as depressed as ever i feel claustrophobic i feel exhausted i feel totally alone in this world i hate thinking so much when im alone with my thoughts i feel like i m walking into a dark room filled with dangerous predators and locking the door behind me ,0
My mom is diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer last year I ve been trying my best to provide her treatment while ensuring least amount of discomfort and pain to her Now since few days her situation got complicated She is not able to move much and needs oxygen supply I m sitting with her in the hospital since 10 days The place causes my anxiety and on that her situation isn t helping On that financial strain is also a factor I was planning for situation but this was unexpected Now Im feeling like fighting a lost battle The burden of medical bills her condition and this place is giving me severe anxiety ,0
Not being alive would be awesome I just want to stop feeling like talking about how I feel will ruin things Or that I m being a bother Life Is precisely too much effort and I don t want to hurt the like 2 people who would care If I died but man every other day overdosing sounds more and more appealing Counseling Is also effort How can people tell me they want me alive when everything Is too difficult for me I wish I could say hey I feel like I should kill myself lately I could really use your comfort to a friend and not feel like I m being unbearable I m sad ,0
i feel like im destined to end my own life im not going to anytime soon but i just feel like a few years down the line ill have to do it im so fucking irresponsible and childish that it only makes sense to check in early maybe ill kms when im in college so my roommate can get a 4 0 And i dont get the whole people will miss you shtick None of that shit ll matter if im too busy being dead to care ,0
umm i m not sure if this is the right thing to post here cuz im new but i need somewhere to vent about this so ever since my aunt passed away when i was 9 ish i ve had depression It made me have this 24 7 empty feeling as though like im just faking all my emotions and im really just a void of nothingness underneath even when I m happy or something its always temporary and i feel like none of the emotions I feel are genuine because of this empty feeling So basically I feel like im just some sort of emotionless robot that s desperately trying to replicate emotions or something Even if its not true Does anyone else feel like this I wish I didn t cause I want to enjoy life to the fullest but I just can t and I hate it ,0
Today I talked to someone who got out of depressionHe said that he couldn t stand hurting everyone around him so he just pushed himself to get better But I don t have that strength or I can t find it I m surviving with the comfort that it will end soon I just haven t found a 100 chance of dying accessible to me right now And is he really doing better anyway He built a strong anti friends wall and I m doing the same The less people you have around the less you will hurt people when you die ,0
alive igalive i gues they put me under a watch i wasnt allowed on anything but i was never admitted i judt need to talk to someone i was doing ok and noe its all coming back i know what i am capable of i just want to talk please,0
1 year ago my 7 month old cat went missing I don t know how he went missing I don t know how it happened one day I wake up and he s not there he meant a lot to me because I wanted a pet since 6 years old he was spoiled with love I searched for him everywhere I asked everyone in the neighborhood for help but still nothing after a month I still had hope he was alive and I always left the windows open in Hopes of him coming back 1 year later he still didn t show up the fact that he was dead was hard to swallow I still wish I had one last chance to see and hug him I feel irresponsible I feel like I didn t take care of him I feel like a bad person ,0

Is anybody else here plagued by constant stress related intrusive thoughts They come from nowhere and always involuntarily They seem to be related to stress since higher levels of stress make them worse for me For me most of the times it s a fantasy i get stuck into There are arguments with other people in my head feelings of anger and the stress that it produces I could be going about doing my thing at home or at work and they will pop up from nowhere The only time they seem to not be able to appear is when I am talking to someone Does anyone else experience this If so any tips for managing it x200B For those who don t know this is the wikiedia definition of intrusive thoughts An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought image or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate ,0

So my sister had given me a whole spiel about her and her ex boyfriend and at the end of it when I told her to basically just drop the guy but in a more nicer tone she just tells me you don t know until you re in a relationship you re still too young granted I ve never been in any kind of serious relationship but I recently just turned 20 so I feel my advice shouldn t be any less than and that s how my sister makes me feel Then she apologizes for telling me her problems but what s the point I know sometimes she just wants to be heard out but the list of reasons to not be with her ex boyfriend is too long I just want the best for my sister and I know he ain t it,0
My safe option was always by drug overdose My mom s a doctor so that should be easy Nuh uh not easy at all do not recommend It s been 3 days and I still feel like shit my heart s beating like crazy and I can barely move without getting dizzy I did NOT sign up for this I want to kill the pain not cause it I thought I was just gonna sleep then not wake up Well I did wake up and now I have diarrhoea Are you kidding me Most of the other methods are way too painful and dangerous if I don t succeed What I took was supposed to be lethal for an adult and I m barely a teenager Goddamn immune system I probably won t try for a while I don t wanna feel like this again I hate this ,0

I m not even sad at the idea of dying I m excited Every second for me is painful to sit through but there are still some things I want to try in life I ve been sleeping most of the day and waking up at night and once I wake up after a long sleep I cannot go back to sleep for like 6 hours Everything that entertains me somehow only last for a little bit of time and I am so tired of having a consciouness Time seems so slow last week seems like it was ages ago and I m inpatient I set myself to die when I m about 40 because I don t want to live too long For the first time in a couple of years I have an actual friend but I fear she might stop talking to me because I talk about the same shit over and over again and use her as a therapist but I just can t help myself nothing exciting ever happens in my life ,0

Feel like I m destined to be alone so I might as well dieI m an only child and grew up spending most of my time by myself Both my parents are dead so no family I don t have any friends either I feel like my only option for getting any type of love in my life is through relationships but I absolutely hate dating culture today Most guys my age just want sex I ve also got too much baggage and issues I m suicidal for fucks sake lmao I haven t thought about killing myself since July now here I am again I m starting to believe that my life will end by my own hands it has to Even if I don t do it today or next year I know that I will always be suicidal ,0

Just need someone to talk to I honestly don t know how to go on anymore I ve been so depressed this past month due to a sudden break up with my girlfriend who I care so much about as well as several other instances leaving me feel inadequate The ex SO in question was a really good friend for years and around six months ago we started dating because we both clicked so well The tl dr of it is basically she is a grade older and wants to be single for her freshman year of college which to me seems really shallow Some of my problems may not seems as large as other people s problems but they are what they are and I dread waking up the next day to more disappointment The only thing keeping me from ending everything is the fact that I have no access to any quick ways to end my life I could really use someone to talk to to vent a friend to get through this chapter of life I hate feeling this way because my life is only just beginning but I don t think I have the willpower to go on much longer ,0

The past few weeks I ve been feeling really bad just for no reason and recently I developed an extreme hatred for myself Like inside of me splits into half and half of me take myself as my own enemy I talked to my GP my counsellor and the Samaritans I take the tablets and tried suggestions they gave me but it all didn t work really well Like those things only help me at that moment but in the end it all comes back to where it was and started draining me out I try to keep myself calm during the day but at night while everyone is asleep that s when I get extremely mad at myself like I m losing my mind I have to bite cut myself so the pain calms me down but I know this isn t right and can t be a long term solution Please if someone has gone through something similar let me know how you ve overcome this Thank you so much ,0

Everytime i go outside i do something embarasing i m so tired of my existence I feel like my brain is too foggy to actually do anything well My mom ordered me to paycheck something yay let s fucking let something so important to a depressed ADHD person that it s likely goingto fuck up and not pay atention what could it go wrong okay the door was locked but there where people inside i see there s people waiting outside well for some reason my brain through it was a good idea to not go to the queue so i standed still there for 4 minutes and people where looking at me and i realize what the fuck im doing and i embarasingly go to the queue wanting to die inside Then when i finially go inside the receptionists tells me i don t have x thing so i have to come back latter it was so embarassing When i arrived home i started to cry i m just so fucking imcompetent my brain doesn t work well i m fucking broken ,0
i recently had an extremely vivid suicide dream feeling the same as i do sometimes but then actually acting on it i went through the whole thing and it took what felt like quite a while and felt this emotional rollercoaster of extreme guilt regret but then ultimately relief this is extremely difficult to process and it took me a while to write this because i don t want to contribute to anyone s misery or inadvertantly encourage anything But I wonder if this dream was about me acting out my inner subconscious feelings and those feelings being realistic I guess the only way to know would be someone who has had a similar experience and failed attempt Again sorry if this is triggering or unhelpful to others I m just having a really hard time processing it ,0

At the beginning of each month my depression is almost non existent Towards the end of the month it is unbearable I have cash at the beginning of the month Non around the 15th each month Why do doctors not prescribe money to cure depression I am absolutely positive that if I would get 6000 7000 per month I would be a lot better I would probably be so well that I would be a valuable member of society ,0
25 no friends no job no degree no real will to live I m just bad at suicideAs per title I m tired of shitty side effects from medications that seem more or less randomly prescribed and I m tired of fighting even to make appointments with psychologists psychiatrists whose hands are tied because they re working in under resourced systems I ve attempted at least twice if you can call my shitty attempts at hanging actual attempts I say at least twice because I ve been involuntarily hospitalized twice one time the police were sent to my door All the hospitals do here is hold you and pump you full of drugs there s no therapy no plan post release it s a complete crap shoot All they ve done is teach me to never talk about suicide with therapists or anyone who knows where I am which I guess is what they want because that way I m consuming fewer resources I m just a drain on society that needs to go away ,0

Not sure if this is the right sub Looking for help I ve struggled with severe depression on and off for a few years It has gotten really bad within that past few months At moments it seems like it s getting better and then I fall back into depression again It s getting to the point where I m scared to be home alone because I m afraid of what I might do I ve come close to self harm suicide a few times I ve tried talking to friends about this and I ve tried expressing my feelings through art I write lyrics but none of that worked for me I m still depressed and lost I think I might actually need professional help I have no idea how to do this though I ve heard of people checking into like mental hospitals idk if that s what they re actually called Where can I find one Is it a good option And feel free to suggest any other options Anytime I ve tried looking for help with depression on google it just gives me 10 step guides to make depression magically go away ,0

 I say I don t care but then why do I care if people worry That s only reason why I haven t harmed myself externally I just don t want to worry people I have said this to many friends but if i where to die I d like to be alone so I could be dead knowing that no one knows I m gone and know one worry s I only feel like I exist to want the companionship of a relationship Why does it feel like everyone is watching me judging me being disappointed in me Expressing my thoughts and feelings seem to hurt people and push them away so I shouldn t express anything and keep hiding behind my fake smile I guess I should because if not then id worry people ,0

I want to die not just for no reason at all It s not just a deep depression or something It s a simple awareness of what life really is and what a fucked up cycle it is We are just vessels through which DNA gets to propagate itself All life forms are but we re all competing for which DNA lineage gets to dominate control and consume the rest of them Humans have obviously already won that battle It s all just a sick competition between life forms trying to kill steal dominate take advantage of one another and it can t change It s happening between every single celled microbe plant animal I can t believe any conscious human would actually continue this fucked up cycle I can t wait to leave this fucked up shit and have my DNA lineage be erased forever ,0
For the last 1 2 years I did everything I can think of to try and make new friends I feel so alone and isolated I just wanted to find a place where I fit in It never worked I realized that the more I tried and the more it didn t work the crappier I felt So I stopped trying Even though it was difficult for me to accept at first it is possible to be alone without being lonely The more I focus on this the more free I feel The less I rely on others and the more I rely on myself the more power is back in my own hands ,0

 ive been struggling with symptoms for depression for over a year i feel completely invalidated by my own feelings even though i think im depressed i tell myself i have no reason to be i have a good family and we re well off i have a lot of friends but all of this and i still struggle im surrounded by suicide and have been for awhile now i feel trapped it s not that my parents don t care but when they walk into my room and im clearly upset and they ask what s wrong i tell them i don t know because i don t know why im crying or even why im sad they don t believe me so i always have to make up an excuse recently my mom asked me if i was depressed and i feel like that was my time to ask for help but i don t want to admit that im actually struggling with it i told her i was just lazy i dont have anything to tell a therapist as to why im sad but do you think i should seek help anyway ,0
I m so tired of living and going to work and being harassed by wannabe gangsters threatening me or my life off of work having my boss not give a crap about my mental health or safety Wanting a relationship but can t for the life of me be interesting or desirable because I can t even love myself enough to do so I want to be able to let all this go but having no one trustful to talk to is lonely can t talk to a hotline because I find it hard to believe anyone who doesn t know you can convince me that I matter I was told that I m strong but I feel like I m just one awful day to having a bad end ,0
I got a dog when I was five as a pet and now I ve grown accustomed to him his name is Willie and when all else in my life is shit I turn to him for comfort Im now 16 and Willie is approaching his death bed I cant handle the fact knowing he s on his last year Most of all I cant handle the possibility that he will no longer be at my side to comfort me When I was stressed out from school Willie is there when I was dealing with a break up Willie is there when I lost my grandparents Willie was there when I had no friends Willie was as loyal as ever Now I don t know what to do I ve already cried and despite him being terminally sick I cant bring myself to put him down So my question reddit is how do I find the will to go on after his death How do I find the strength within me to fight back against the tears and comfort myself without his slobbery face at my side ,0

I ve just finished school and my depression has never been worse I would rather literally kill myself than working like a slave for the rest of my life Maybe I m mentally retarded or something But I don t see the point in doing this Anyway I was studying med school not doctor and there s a job I could potentially apply for that probably wouldn t be bad but I don t know if I can do that I have zero experience and I m always nervous in new environment Who the hell would like to work with someone like me Also my communicating skill is almost non existent Even if they d invite me for a job interview what the hell would I tell them On the other hand I m ready to kill myself in 48 days so Do these anxious thoughts even matter ,0

They always talk but when I say something they never answer and it makes me really sad But at the same time I don t want to bother them with my problems so I wanna not say anything at all I think it s because I talk to much so I try to stop talking to them so much but then a lot of stuff happens and I want to tell them about it I just wish they would answer me It makes me think I did something wrong and then I cry and I don t want to cry anymore I want them to know that I m miserable and sad but I don t want them to think differently of me It s taken to long to get to the relationship I have built with them and I really don t want to ruin that ,0

things will never get betterI m really really tired of hearing people say it gets better When When is that supposed to happen I ve been hearing that literally my entire life I m almost in my mid 20s now Maybe at 40 50 When I don t want to suffer just for the off chance one day I won t want to die I ve actively wanted to die since I was 8 8 I m 23 I m in therapy And I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist coming up I just don t believe it ll ever be better Ever My uncle killed himself and my family is fine Had fun at the memorial Wasn t terribly affected My mom legit told me that she thinks it s better when mentally ill people kill themselves because then they re happier and the people around them are happier because they aren t being drained by the person s mental illness anymore What am I supposed to do with THAT Honestly last month it marked 5 years since I last attempted but I can t see myself sticking around for the entirety of 2019 ,0
I did not graduate yet I m very late and I have no excuse I was mentally and psychologically weak when I should have been strong last year I basically failed because someone broke my heart Some people deal with worse shit every day and still succeed but not me The only refuge I have today is a fantastic mom sport and theatre but I m socially late to a frustrating point I didn t even get laid yet Maybe I m exaggerating but I feel like it s gonna get worse Sorry if it s annoying I know many people have much more serious problems but I have nowhere to vent ,0

Does anyone feel like their family just doesn t get it A little background my whole family with the exception of my parents are on some sort of antidepressant We re all trying to cope Some of us are doing better than others I m happy for them a little jealous to be honest Some background on me I m married father of two 44 Still figuring out life sorry to say it doesn t get easier The last two years of my life have been a mess My wife and I split and reconciled right before covid For that I m glad Over that time I took up painting as an outlet for my depression and something to do It s helping I m getting better and painting has opened some doors for me Not enough to quit my day job unfortunately But enough to make me want to keep on painting My family acts supportive but not in a satisfying way So I guess I m looking for some sort of validation Can anyone relate ,0
Next month it ll be two years since my dad died I ve changed careers met the love of life I m really trying to work on my mental health issues and to just be a good person I still wake up once a week in the middle of the night and sob I still glaze over and tear up once or twice a week at work My heart feels so full and so empty It hurts so much more than I ever thoughr it could ,0
Feeling like it s gonna be that time again when I sit and think about why I ve let myself go on this long I turn 24 soon Never got an education never been employed Living with someone who sexually harasses me daily Drinking alcohol every night to feel more than this empty apathy Unmedicated for this constant mental anguish that makes me wanna punch myself until I m black and blue because at least bruises don t leave scars like the ones on my wrists that remind me I didn t have the guts to go the whole way Why d I let it get so bad Why didn t I do something years ago Why am I still bothering to wake up everyday I m too much of a coward to get it over with wish I d just get something terminal and rot away until there s nothing left ,0
People are welcome to talk about their personal experiences including societal and environmental factors It should be clear from even a glance at the front page that we re fine with that But supporting an individual is an entirely different process from supporting a cause Both are important of course ,0
Has anybody here had a bad mental breakdown If in the past do you still reflect on it I had mine last year I couldn t eat drink or sleep properly for about 3 months my hair thinned I lost weight no showers As I was recovering my partner moved out while I was at work I called the samaritants every other night just to talk to somebody I keep thinking about it and I m in a much better place now but it s so damn scary ,0
I m so exhausted Tired and broken I m not anything to anybody anymore and everything is my fault I did it to myself because I ve always hated myself for being less than I m not a good person son brother etc I just don t see a reason for living much longer I try to distract myself with porn and video games and the internet in general but its not working I want to die I NEED to die I m watching myself age and sink further into utter ruin I don t have a reason to live The only thing holding me back is time I want to die outside in the cold I figure the least I could do is not kill myself in my mothers attic and have the nosy neighbors witness my body being carried out ,0
After E3 next week I think it will be about time I leave I was going to say I m near the end of my rope but I ve since lost the rope years ago How am I still going What actually keeps me here Well one I didn t have a method readily available a quick method at that Not much kept me tethered here besides a few people and my dog I ve lost almost all enjoyment of the things I once loved I m tired to the bone ALL The Time And I just don t see any benefit to me being here All I ever do is frustrate and piss people off even my closest friends They don t deserve someone like me they deserve someone better I m pathetic and can t do anything right I live in fantasies all the time in order to cope with all my oppressive thoughts There are many reasons why I want to die but I just needed to get some of this out here ,0
I m obsessed with the idea of killing myselfYay I m a psychopath Can t wait to act on it,0
I think you are being just an aware human in today s world The system is set up this way No financial literacy classes in high school forcing people to go to college and picking up bad debt with no ROI having rent be 2X more expensive than a mortgage payroll taxes vs capital gains taxes etc My only concern and what adds to my depression is the fact that nobody cares I feel like the Canadian govt is for the people but why do I slightly cringe when I think of America as being for the people Maybe we all just aren t capitalists and we were born in the wrong place and that s making us depressed ,0
i don t have a reason for being here i fuck everyone up do nothing but ruin people s lives by being in them i m either numb or angry 24 7 i m just ready for everything to be over i ve attempt 3 times in the last month and i ve failed all of them the only thing i m good at is failing i won t fail this time i ll make sure of it this is goodbye ,0
I recently about a month ago started therapy to try to fix my self issues But to be honest it s been really hard I m trying to open up and be real in order to help myself but I keep feeling all these emotions like shame embarrassment even the feeling that I m wasting my therapists time that I don t deserve this help Also I feel like I m even more in my head than before I know self reflecting is the road to improvement but right now it feels like self reflecting just makes me feel even worse about myself After every session I put my head in my hands and think what the hell am I doing for a solid 10 minutes I don t blame my therapist for any of this she seems great and she has good advice I think it s my own discomfort at facing my emotions But does this mean I m just not ready for therapy yet Or is this all part of the process Is this really going to help me I don t know yet ,0

So I m a 20 year old guy from the UK It s been suggested by a doctor that I may have some forms of depression and anxiety I was asked to get in contact with people to get some counselling but I never felt I was worth wasting the time on and I should just get on with it I have literally one friend but I don t want to bother them with all of my issues I just wondered if there s any people who might want to chat just for someone to talk to on the lonely days and nights like now I m sorry if I ve talked too much but if you would like to talk could you drop a comment or a message Also I m sorry if this isn t the right place to do this I m really at my last resort now,0
I m sorry if this isn t the right subreddit to post direct me to go somewhere else if it isn t So i went to the psychiatrist today with the expectation to get prescribed some stimulants or take some test that ll get me some point is i got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and i was prescribed Zoloft I didn t lie to the psychiatrist told her all about past and my current situation I m honestly not even that depressed I m pretty functional I m outside everyday i have random bouts of 1 hour depression but that s it I have a lot to look forward to I m just honestly confused,0

24F sad and exhaustedI ve been isolated for years and opened up to two people earlier this year even though I knew I wasn t ready to have friends One friendship ended in June and the other ended on Sunday This isn t even the biggest stressor of my life but wow was it a cherry on top of everything Finally starting a job soon and will have the freedom to pick a method soon I m just so tired of feeling like a freak and being rejected and being talked about ,0
I m not allowed to be happyNo matter what I do things are always at the state that they could be good if it weren t for one thing It s almost as if I am not allowed to ever feel happy and I am punished for being alive Sometimes I wonder if it s my punishment for not believing in god and maybe he isn t fictional and this is my limbo for denying his existence The only time I ever felt connected with anyone they betrayed me And the more I think about it the more I realize I fucked it up I cannot change the past but I d want to do anything to go back and do things differently I cannot live in the NOW because I cannot bear the idea that I am helpless I shouldn t have been All these years I didn t see the plan through because I was waiting for a guy to come and save me or maybe to come and join me I am not sure But no one ever came and if they came it was just to ruin me further Thanks to all of you My existence is torture and I ll make sure to clean the slate ,0
I ve had enoughI ve decided that I m going to kill myself Thank you for trying to help me goodbye ,0
Fucked uptry to break scissors sitting in front of girl i like scissors broke stabbed the veins in my wrist by accident girl i like freak out blood come out girl freak out more i go to hospital she dont talk to me what do,0
So I have a phone call every couple of months with my psychiatrist Today my psychiatrist was upset with me because I hadn t made doctor appointments even tho I told her it s been a hectic time for me She told me that she would write a contract for me to make me more accountable and that if I don t follow through with it she would stop giving me medication I was wondering if this is something that is commonly done This whole situation made me feel uncomfortable but I wanted to know if I m just being to anxious or something ,0
Every time I think life is becoming bearable everything falls apartI just don t know what to do anymore I ve been struggling with depression for 5 years and after I attempted to kill myself and failed I tried to turn my life around and I succeeded for awhile I got a good job made good friends and found a girl who I thought was the one Then everything got swept out from under me i lost my job my girl left me my friends left Now I m back alone with only myself to rely on and I swear the hardest part of everyday is lying awake at night wondering if it s even worth it to keep pushing on I don t the answers within me all I feel is empty and every night suicide is the only recurring thought I just want to feel ok again I have forgotten what that actually feels like,0
I m useless to anybody I know,0
mirrorsdoes anyone else have like n ok time but then u pass a mirror and it s like o fuck I should die I m shook so ugly is fucked,0

I actually want to live Last year I wanted to die I had terrible anxiety depression and OCD Then I had a mental breakdown I even searched for how to commit suicide in the most painless way Or at least prayed i died in my sleep Existing was torment Less than a year later I feel 10x better Actually better than before I had my mental breakdown Am I saying this to torment you Not at all I m telling you this because even if it makes NO sense right now it can get better It will jf you don t give up Now I am here to help others pay it forward if you will Oh and what makes me so special that I deserve it and you dont You re right NOTHING Except that i dared to believe i deserved it If someone else can be happy why not me Why not you I m not perfectly happy i still have rough days but it gets better as i keep fighting I m fighting for you ,0
I m closer than ever to doing it I keep imagining how my parents will feel and how my sister will feel I keep reflecting on my life I keep thinking about how tragic my death would be I keep trying to talk myself down every day and imagine a better future but none of it feels realistic and everything just seems to be getting worse for everyone collectively and I have no desire to move forward I don t see a good future with me in it I feel like I want to die every day I m at 30 seconds to midnight but I can t do it ,0
I m sorry if that sounds horribly insensitive to people with who are terminally ill and I know there a lot of people who are who also suffer from depression And I would gladly give my life to someone who does want to be here if it meant saving theirs But at least if I did have some disease that I knew would kill me then I would have an expiration date 80 years is a long time to suffer I hope something or someone kills me before then something or someone other than me ,0
Yo I kinda just found out my little sister is harming herself and I m kinda unsure of what to do and how to help I ve suffered from severe depression before but stopped myself from self harming so I just don t know what to do,0
I want to kill myself one of these days but I m too much of a bitch to I m almost in college It s my senior year I have no idea what I want to do and I still have to take the ACT I m not smart enough for a job that pays well I d probably be stuck in the minimum wage world for the rest of my life It s not hard to get a gun in my state so by the time I hit 25 I m ending my shitty life I cut myself but it doesn t satisfy my thirst for pain I want something new in my life and cutting doesn t give me a rush anymore It used to make me feel cold but I feel nothing anymore If I continue to live I will become homeless ,0

Hello I am looking for a friend who can listen to me I have fought depression since my childhood About three years ago the depression came to me as a robbery with a handgun And now this same depression came to me as a fully armored army I think I cannot handle the depression I need someone who can keep it confidential ,0
I need help figuring out what s wrong with me I know I want to kill myself but I go in and out of knowing why that is I ll have everything planned for my suicide and know exactly what to do to follow through But then a couple days later I ll go into some trance where I don t remember why I should or shouldn t kill myself It s like my memory is wiped every few days and I forget all my own thoughts and opinions A more accurate way to put it might be that I repeatedly gain and lose motivation to live First I ll have eyes for nothing but my suicide but then all of a sudden it ll seem like there s so much to get out of life Then I ll fall right back into desperately wanting to kill myself It s so exhausting going through this cycle over and over again It d be fine if I was set on one way or the other At least there d be clarity that way At this point I want to kill myself mainly to stop all this Why is my brain like this What do I do ,0
Just now i saw my aunt post her daughter s my first cousin arts It was so wonderful despite she is a beginner I was really into arts and drawing when i was 13 until 20 Both of my parents were never compliment my arts and they never support my dream to be comic manga artist Seeing my aunt feel so proud and appreciate her child s talent and passion is really sting to me I wish my parents let me be whatever i want to and allow me to do whatever things made me feel happy and alive Due to the lack of support and constant judgement I m eventually stop drawing and do arts I feel like a boring person with no personalities right now I m also have no interest in other things even i tried to excited myself It s midnight now goodnight My eyes quite swollen due to crying and i feel like a twat crying over small things Thanks for reading ,0
n b I m not speaking just to you but to everyone who s been upvoting this comment In addition to what has so wisely pointed out there s another reason why it s a sign that s something s seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule If you re really thinking about others experience then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you If it hasn t then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you re responding to others here for the right reasons Sometimes when we want to help what it means is that we want to feel helpful PM me any time is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful but if you really think about what the other person s experience it feels completely different ,0
If I would overcome my fears and stepout of my comfort zone and finally go to therapy then what What should I tell them That I do drugs That I earn money illegally I don t sell drugs What are they gonna do Lock me in the psychatry or prison Or even both And what should I say what my next move is To be honest my next move isn t going to university or doing something normal it s doing more drugs harder drugs to escape reality I can t do this anymore I didn t do drugs for 3 days and I am beyond miserable,0

Still DrowningI ve been depressed on and off for years but when my grandma passed away this year I became lost Suicide never leaves my mind for more then a few hours a day I rarely leave my home or speak to anyone and Im tired She raised me and she was my heart my backbone and we were so close I have no friends or family now and I feel like I m just waiting until I finally have the balls to end it The fact that I m even typing this out make me feels like there s an ounce of hope in me which confuses the hell out of me It sounds insane but now living scares the hell out of me Yet when I picture myself taking that last breath for some reason this comforts me and eases my anxiety Any comments or advice would be appreciated ,0

Just for a moment to remember when nothing mattered and to experience what it was like to be genuinely happy But knowing that s impossible it s a good thing Knowing I have nothing to look forward to makes all the meaningless suffering just that everything s predictable Tm brings nothing just waiting to die Funny reminiscing on the past I realized none of it mattered Every day is lost today will be tm and tm I m dead,0

Is anybody else here plagued by constant stress related intrusive thoughts They come from nowhere and always involuntarily They seem to be related to stress since higher levels of stress make them worse for me For me most of the times it s a fantasy i get stuck into There are arguments with other people in my head feelings of anger and the stress that it produces I could be going about doing my thing at home or at work and they will pop up from nowhere The only time they seem to not be able to appear is when I am talking to someone Does anyone else experience this If so any tips for managing it x200B For those who don t know this is the wikiedia definition of intrusive thoughts An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought image or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate ,0

suicideI have bipolar disorder I take medication that sort of works Right now is one of those times where I m thinking about suicide Some reasons why I don t feel right in this body not a gender identity thing just general discomfort I m scared of the outside world especially vehicles I m bad in social situations therapist thinks I have asperger syndrome and I m getting tested for it I m 20 and never had a job and the prospect of getting an education for a career in my current state is laughable So I spend my days with no hope for tomorrow I try to stop myself and think positively but sadly one thing I don t have is psychosis Well maybe a little bit So I should probably just wait until I don t feel like killing myself right ,0

I ve been feeling very suicidal the past monthI feel like I don t have anybody to tell this so I m posting it here I don t have a plan but I have images flash through my mind constantly I just really don t want to be here anymore It s so exhausting and nothing I do seems to stick I feel like a piece of garbage and want to throw myself out I feel like I ve put so much work into managing my illnesses that I don t even know what the point is anymore I still can t hold a job my closest friends are just not emotionally available and my marriage is sinking to what it was before You d think with aging and all the therapy that I wouldn t let these be problems No matter what I feel so empty and alone I hate the gripping feeling of wanting to do ANYTHING to escape I like to believe I am strong enough to not do injustice to myself again but boy is it gnawing ,0

A common deterrent is to think of your family and friends Why am I subject to their feelings Straight to the point For myriad reasons I ve occasionally thought about killing myself for years These last few months have made that a daily contemplation The how mostly I d like to spare my family some pain I ve tried to think of accidents like crashing my car I would never shoot myself That would be the worst I could do My real question is the title It sounds harsh but when I don t see the point in anything how can I be forced to stick out the tedium for their sake To be clear I m not On the edge Like I said earlier I m just contemplating ,0
Fuck thisFuck my life I can t even find anything that makes me happy anymore I ve already cut off all of my friends months ago and I think I m finally ready to kill myself My moms already disappointed in me because apparently if I have anything less than a fucking A in a class then I m the biggest disappointment ever and that something is wrong with me I just can t fucking take it anymore I m 15 and I don t even want to do anything in my future anymore I already have my suicide note written so it s just a matter of time before I finally go through with it ,0

I think I always knew it would end like this I always try and trick myself into thinking there s hope Maybe my family will care and stand beside me as I get help But it hasn t happened It makes you feel like a burden When every time you ask your mom to talk to a doctor about you feel she sighs and gets annoyed every time you ask Even though it s important and you know you ll kill yourself eventually without it I can t hold on anymore Every day gets harder the longer I go on I think it s time I sort things out and figure out how I m gonna do this I think I always knew I d end up killing my self I just didn t think it would be so soon I just want to matter to them But all I do is make everybody miserable with everything I do It s no wonder my family doesn t care I guess we ll see if I figure out how everything ends I m done living in a recurring cycle of misery and guilt Maybe I ll finally be gone for good ,0

Hi Every since covid hit I have been struggling with being sad all the time and depressed I was 13 when it started and have not been the same since The problem is usually the reason I m sad is because I m super insecure of my weight how I look I also never go out with people I used to because I break down because I hate how I look Everytime this happens or im depressed for a few days I eat way to much it s basically a viscous cycle that happens all the time pretty much some days are better then others but always bad I was wondering if anyone have any suggestions on how to stop eating a lot or how to loose weight or even have to love myself what ever works If anyone else has struggled with this and has found a way to cope that would be great to know some tips ,0

I have lot of problems with mental illness and I ve been through a lot of trauma The work it would take to function like a normal person and the fact that I d have to manage my symptoms for the rest of my life is just too monumental a task for me And life overall seems miserable anyway so why bother getting better Nobody s ever been able to convince me that it s worth the time and effort or that I m worth anything at all And so I ve realized that that is the core problem If someone could give me real reasons to get better maybe I d be willing to try again And I m curious as to what those reasons would be so I m thinking maybe I ll try to call a hotline or something and see what they say if I even manage to get an operator on the line But I m pretty confident in my reasoning skills if nothing else and I doubt that anyone is going to say anything I haven t already heard before ,0

I feel like I m out of optionsEver since I was 10 I ve had depression and terrible anxiety Every day since I was 15 I ve thought of killing myself and now I m 20 Recently the thoughts have become more and more recent and aggressive My parents argue a lot and I fight with my mom non stop these days I just feel like offing myself would be the best way to do anything from here on ,0
Fat dab and suicideBliss ,0
So lonelyHow do you all keep going Every day I question more and more why I continue to live day after day in a life that brings me absolutely no joy ,0
This is what a family member said to me today My posts here are usually pretty long but I feel so empty that I can t even be mad I feel so invalidated ,0
I m going to kill myself Anyone wanna chat before I do it Yeah I know this looks like a cry for attention but I m a bit past that I know exactly what this sized line will do cross referenced with my body weight and zero tolerance for said substance Even if I don t die at least I ll find out I m immortal Lol Feel like having a nice real conversation before I go That s all ,0
I know for a fact that I have some form of depression But all of my reasons for being feeling depressed sound so silly to me that it stops me from asking my Mum if I can see a doctor to properly diagnose me They all sound so stupid which always leads me to regret the fact that I use a suicide prevention line Some of the questions that I ask myself are like Why would you tell this stranger Why are you such a fucking wimp Why I normally end up screaming internally inside my bed I used to cry myself to sleep but now there aren t any tears left I sing myself songs of my childhood And I m very surprised that A nobody has noticed yet and B I m not in a mental hospital ,0
i ve been on lexapro for almost 2 months and i ve had some weird symptoms imo i have lost over 10 pounds and have picked up the very bad habit of procrastinating anything and everything recently i ve had a lot going on family and work wise and i feel the depression cloud creeping up i need a hobby or something but i don t feel like i have the time also is it possible i could be building dependency already sorry this post was all over the place answer any questions you can it is greatly appreciated ,0
I work on myself obsessively like I m genuinely obsessed with self improvement Without thinking though I act like a total bastard and people get hurt and I have to pick up the pieces and apologize again for who I am This isn t a suicide note or anything it s just something that always comes up when I m having suicidal episodes I want to be a better person but it sometimes feels impossible ,0
Sorry the title pretty much says it all I finally fell asleep at about 1am because I was absolutely exhausted but I had this really morbid nightmare and woke up at 2 50 It was graphic as hell and really disturbing I was too scared to fall asleep again so now I m shattered The worst part was waking up in a cold sweat and desperately longing for my ex I just wanted to cling to them and sob I was terrified and they re the first place my mind went to I don t think they ll ever understand how much they meant to me and how willing I was to stick around when things got hard I just wanted them I think this might have pushed me a little further so Idk if I m gonna survive the week at this rate I don t see a point in living ,0
Please I need someone to talk with him her ,0
Had a post like this a while ago I think I deleted it I m gonna be gone later this week Thanks for all the support from this subreddit but nothing can stop my abusive sister lousy parents and all the shit I put with before Goodbye,0
I have troubles discovering something starting it and keeping doing it Maybe it s because of my past experiences because of how my life has been I don t know Apparently without succeeding in what I wrote up there I will never really be able to find a job and settle for something I really don t know what to do,0
I m useless and better off deadits true im just working up the courage to finally kill myself this is what i want cos i cant handle living anymore idk how people can stand being alive i dont have a job i dont have my license i dont have much friendsy im not smart or talented kr passionate i have no goal or plan for my future bcos ever since i was 14 ive been wanting to kill myself and now that im 21 im still the same suicidal pussy who cant even get that right so my life is worthless i cant even hold a relationship im too scared to be vulnerable and trust someone and even if i did id just endure more hell bcos im a lesbian with strict catholic parents idk what to do whats the point of it all and all my friends are in relationships and im reminded of how unlovable and pathetic i am,0
In the hospital under certification feeling hopeless I am writing this from the hospital Thank god I have wi fi or I would go insane all together I was certified last Friday because the doctor believes I am suffering from Anorexia Nervosa I am 85 Lbs at 5 foot 2 a reasonable weight for my height On Friday I was told that they were going to certify me and give me an IV TPN no lipids The doctor told me right away that I had no say in this I got really upset so they knocked me out and I woke up connected to IV 72 hours later they signed the second certificate They are not letting me out until I put on weight which I am not going to agree to I don t feel like getting into it to much but being skinny is the only option for me I am female to male and if I gain weight I will look like a woman This is killing me inside and I don t know how much more I can take I hope I die soon ,0
Thank you for picking up and talking to me I don t even know your name but you gave me lots of comfort and allowed me to just pour out the pain that had been overflowing in my heart I was able to cry without judgement or fear of rejection You didn t even know me but you got mad for me You comforted me and told me that yes you re being mistreated You got mad that I still stayed You told me to stand up for myself like a supportive dad I never had I hope we can talk again someday I want to properly thank you once I get better ,0
Read the title,0
Officially started cutting myselfI m just inherently unlikeable I ve never had a friend or girlfriend Among many other issues I have Asperger s syndrome so I m awkward I m shy and have no social skills or conversational skills so I m boring and not interesting For reference look at this post I made because I don t feel like explaining it again  ,0
I want to kill myselfThere really isn t hope for me And I ve thought this same exact way since at least 10 I hope I can just stop breathing tonight ,0
I am going to be 100 honest I feel that the reason I am the way i am today is because of how i was raised Even if that wasn t intentional i just know that my parents made a lots of mistakes when it came to rasing me So anytime I d came across weird or straight up crazy I would always have an explanation for that ,0
Today Is my birthdayI know it s a suicide place but I was feeling like overdosing on nyquil the whole day since my girl friend broke up with me and she s a liar ,0
I can t seem to enjoy anything anymore Everything is boring and colorless even the things I used to love All I can think about is how life is so hard Why should I keep working for the rest of my life everyday nonstop just to do die in the end I don t think life is worth living anymore Those ideas are eating me everyday and I don t even have enough money to go to a therapist they are really expensive where I live I m exhausted really really exhausted ,0
Well after years of this bullshit I honestly believe am going to die alone and forgetten Even when their are times when I try to reach out that broken side of me tells me to give up no one wants me around Even when someone does talk to me I don t believe it s real anymore just being nice taking pity on the loser who has no one ,0
I 26M only ask this as I m tired Like I feel my entire life is a rat race to the next disappointment And unfortunately I don t really think things will get exponentially better over the next 10 years or so I used to live in the future but now I don t really care to see it I am no longer interested in the logical progression of life milestones i e marriage kids home buying etc It just feels really miserable to have to live another 50 70 years when I m so unhappy now ,0
So I really screwed up a chunk of my life From 19 23 I isolated in my room It s the cold truth and I m real ashamed about it I cut off all my friends and only talked to the most toxic group in my life a bunch of older guys I played COD with who I d been trying to impress but always got made fun of and singled out I only stayed because it was interaction with the safety of being online Well I went out and challenged my anxiety got a job at a grocery store and things are getting better again The only problem is after all those years of self loathing I get a lot of are you okay Or Lighten up Or Something bothering you when everything really is fine and I m just going about my day So has anyone found a way to get passed this ,0
It s time for me to just give upMy life has no purpose anymore I m tired of feeling this way every minute of every day I ve been dealing with depression and these thoughts for 3 years now It started when I got discharged from the Marines due to an injury Then shortly after getting home my girlfriend of 3 years left me Been down hill from there I have 1 close friend but he lies to me so much and makes up every excuse possible to not hang out with me that I wouldn t even consider him a friend anymore I haven t been on a date or been with a girl in 2 years Stuff I use to love and enjoy doing doesn t even excite me anymore My life is miserable I m currently in the Army now which just sucks the life out of me even more I just don t want to be here anymore I m just going to become another statistic ,0
I guess it is just jealousy Im just over here laying in my room all day alone while they get to have fun with their friends,0
I am confused and scaredA lot of weird bad stuff are happening at the same time and it s scary ,0
it only gives us more pain than what we had to begin with ,0
Keeping my chef knife next to meI don t think I want to die but I know I don t have a good life ahead of me I don t know if it s my medication finally calming me down but I feel less restless and depressed than usual But I ve gotten my work knives out of my bag and I m keeping one next to me It just felt like something I should do I held it up to my wrist and then chest at one point just out of morbid curiosity but that was it I d like to live at least until the end of the year when I get some board games I just backed from kickstarter and I don t want to cause my mother all that grief because she s been so good to me but yeah I feel like getting a friend over after they finish work would be the right thing to do but I don t want to bother them ,0
i ve been quiet as shit for most of my life so i literally didn t even get a chance to develop one anyway i was like bullied at 7 and stuff and they were my big buddies in class to help me read and whatever but they called me annoying and stupid and whatever and i feel like they got me to shut up or smth idk tho and i feel like it s too late for me anyway and i really wanna kms lol,0

Life is meaninglessI just slept 13 hours thinking about my high school crush 3 years ago I imagined how we talked how we just were hanging out and how similar we actually could have been It was so beautiful but also very depressing I didn t so shit since then social anciety kept me 99 of this time in a closed room Now Idk what I should do I am a creep a looser and worse I very bad person I think there are only two options for me prison or death Society shouldn t be obliged to take on the burden of me I loved her so much and I wished I didn t hurt all the people that I interacted with Hopefully I will have to strength to commit my suicide Wish me luck Thanks to all redditers,0

Tonight seems rough Started crying in bed out of nowhere I think work has gotten to me I feel all I do is work and when I come home I m alone I cook dinner for myself And most evenings I stay in I ve been able to go out last week and hang with a friend It s just wild I ll be turning 32 next month Most people my age have kids and shit and or are married I went through a breakup during when Covid hit I don t have any urge to date It s so hot to go running outside currently Usually get that runners high to relieve stress I figure I ll watch something on YouTube so I can fall asleep Just binged a show on Netflix to pass the time ,0
For the past 5 years I ve encountered multiple near death experiences because of my undiagnosed mental health problems I ve tried talking to my parents but they brush it off by telling me I don t deserve to feel sad because there wouldn t be any reason to I completely understand about what they mean but I can t seem to find any happiness in anything I do despite years of trying The voices in my head tell me I m a piece of shit that should go die but I m scared of what killing myself would do to my family I wish I could get at least a diagnoses of my mental state but the money I ve saved can t cover the sessions And I don t want to trouble my family by asking them for money ,0
I tried being optimistic today I told myself that today was going to be a good day 3 24 pm sitting on my bathroom floor crying and drinking good ole pink whitney sigh Typical Sunday afternoon ,0
Im thinking of killing myself cause im so useless I have no talents skills im ugly fat My mom is dissapointed at me and my dad hates me And I think my friends are starting to hate me This past 4 years of my life I think I tried everything so that my parents can be proud of me I started to study hard and got good grades like really good grades next I tried to be fit and be more active again But nothing really changed my parents looked even more dissapointed at me I dont know what to do anymore I cant open up to my parents cause they would be more dissapointed plus they wouldnt care on what I say Thats why I think dying is the best solution Im sorry if my grammar is bad or my story is a bit confusing its just I can think straight at the moment ,0
For all my life ive battled with depression It started ever since the age of 6 when i lost all my hair due to a condition and left me inhibited and paranoid of the world Ive gotten better recently im 20 but i still have this extreme sensitivity to other peoples perception of me Any sort of rejection and i go this depression pit that i cant get out of for a while Luckily i havent experienced any devastating events such as a death of a loved one but i am deeply afraid when the inevitable does happen I dont think when my parents eventually die ill be able to sustain myself ,0

I ve been having breakdowns tantrums over the past year One last August another one last November one last May and just earlier this week My aunt who I ve never had a good relationship with says I m having breakdowns habitually at this point and that I m taking advantage of my family What she meant by habitually is that I m doing this on purpose just to get what I think I want She also says that I think the world revovles around me and that I need to get a grip I don t even know what to think because what she s saying is true I need to get a grip since I feel like I ve just been floating for so long now and whenever I get hit with reality now and then I have a breakdown I m just feeling so much hate and anger within myself and I m just taking it out on my family I want this all to end I m a fucking failure haha,0

So I finally opened to my parents that I ve been struggling with depression but didn t tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it They ve been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist There s a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them I really don t want them knowing about the real reason why I m depressed I feel like I m obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance What should I do ,0
can someone explain overdoseare there no like suicide pills is everything in overdose just going to give you liver failures ect what type of pills do what in overdose,0
everyone wants it nobody wants to give it everyone needs it but nobody wants to share it its the one thing that we all strive for the thing that reassures us at the end of a long day the thing that guides us in the right direction but castes us aside when we need it the most some of us live our whole lives looking for it but end up dying without knowing how it feels others don t even search for it but they find it anyways and it torture s them for the rest of eternity I want it I need it but I m sure I ll never find it because life is unfair like that ,0
Hoping someone has compassion for my situation ,0

Hello When I was a little girl I was thinking about the purpose of this life Everything seemed gray for the most time I couldn t understand how other people were happy when I just didn t care I do care about many things but for the most part it feels as if I have a cloud over my head even when I was little Now I am a grown up and I believe and feel still the same I thought that this will change but it hasn t I am tired There is no fighting because this is me empty and sad and lost and tired and weak etc ,0

Last week after so long of being alone i finally met someone who was awesome and interested in me we would text for hours everyday and then we went on a date and that was great there was so much laughing and smiling In our texts it seemed like she was giving off it s ok to be cuddly with me vibes I thought since our texts explored that kind of stuff I tried to be romantic and hold her hand and etc we went to the movies and I guess I talked a good amount throughout the film and she was probably annoyed I pushed her away and after the date I was blocked it s not damn fair because I felt so close to being with someone who actually cared It s been so long since I was with a girl that gave me so much loving energy She was so beautiful but here I am one week later back to the same boring lonely life ,0
I wish I had the guts to just end it myself But every time I think about doing it it s just too much to think about it I m not quite at the point where I ll do it but I don t want to ever be at that point again ,0

I have these thoughts as well The world is honestly a shit hole But there are little things I still enjoy I hold onto these little things for dear life My faith helps me but it also confuses me as well I don t get why God allows so much pain and misery I don t judge people who give up There s a lot of inequality it seems on what God allows to be given to people The only reason why I haven t killed myself is because I have faith God is helping me I still get the thoughts but I hand them over to God and ask He help me To me thoughts like this are normal considering our world is fallen quite heart breaking Life is very hard but there is still hope ,0

Two sides of me fightingOne side is ready to tackle the world wants to make friends and be loved by someone It has so much confidence and can take on anything The other side pulls me down tells me I m not good enough or pretty enough and to just hide away that I m nothing but a burden to everyone Unfortunately it seems as though my second side is stronger and always wins Does anyone else feel this way I honestly feel useless I have no friends and nothing in my life that keeps me happy I m stuck and I hate it ,0

All I want this Christmas is to kill myself That is all What is the point of life WE ARE DOING NOTHING WE SHOULD ALL KILL OURSELVES Someone please help me PLEASE ,0
it doesn t seem like there s a point to being happy or living at all when things just go back to the sad and lonely default no emotions or feelings at all seems a lot better than even feeling happy because i know the happiness will end its fleeting it s comforting knowing that death means i don t need to feel any more emotions or feelings and that absence of feeling will always be there once i finally do it,0

I have a lot of terrible intrusive thoughts throughout the day and by the end of the night I feel very depressed I ve had med changes for it already and it got a little better at first but now it is bad again I know the thoughts aren t true but overtime enough of them really bring me down The thoughts are mostly things like I m a failure or everyone secretly hates me Sometimes the thoughts are suicidal I also stop feeling safe at night and thoughts of trauma my own or things I ve seen others go through invade my thoughts I dissociate often and experience derealization every day I m in therapy and have spent years working on my trauma and made a lot of progress but recently am struggling through this What has been your own experiences with this and what helped you feel peace again at night ,0

Just want someone to careBefore school started I was really confident and knew what I was doing Now a month later I am seriously considering killing myself The only thing really stopping me is fear and my family at this point I feel like I m not useful for anything I barely have a place among my friends and only get invited to places because I don t talk much mostly listen I m not attractive my grades are starting to slip not very good at a lot of things either Not sure where all my confidence went but I just want this to be over suicide or getting over it I think it might ve started at the realization that no one actually cares a lot for me Sure my parents care but it feels like they don t understand and would just try to force religion down my throat Anyway I ve never had a best friend girlfriend or anyone who actually asks how I m doing Starting to think the world easily forget me Sorry if it got off topic this has been building up for awhile,0
30 years old Father of two one who doesn t see me nor does he care about me The other I care for full time Two years old and perfect in every possible way Partner for 3 going on 4 years Maybe it s a early life crisis or just a wobble But the thoughts of being dead to better those I care about often wanders into my mind By often I mean multiple times a day An extreme feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy not doing enough can t be relied upon not ambitious enough I could go on for hours I can t shift the feeling of my partner looking for an out I m now starting to believe my demise may be that out Deep down I can feel all I truly want is to be wanted Loved unconditionally and intimately I want to be successful and strong in the eyes of those who matter How do you do that when all you know of yourself and what you re constantly reminded of is how inadequate your existing is ,0

Are there any actual reasons to live Logical there seems to very few reasons to live Unless you worship one of the many gods or follow Happiness inducing things such as drugs sex power There are plenty of stock humans to resupply even if half of us died So we no longer live as communities just hermits in our homes most of humans can t even grow their own food and rely on super markets It use to be that each person played a vital role in their village and family Friendships and family ties were close Now it s Only reason to live seem to be based on false teachings or selfishness Ofc there is dedicating yourself to something positive but other than that I can t think of much Opinions ,0

Why can t people with clinical depression be able to get this why does it only have to be people with terminal illness it s BS I m not a bad person I m nice to others I don t bother anyone I suffer in silence why can t I just get a win for once I m going to have to be forced into a violent suicide eventually and I hate that I don t want to go out that way it s scary but I don t have a damn choice because people with clinical depression get treated like weak humans that just can t get over it that s how society sees us we aren t taken seriously it s BS So we are forced into a awful death because of a stupid stigma ,0
Everything is goodI m 22 For the first time in my entire existence I am safe and in a good spot I have never once had a life like I have now but I still want to die and that is what is scaring me so bad Everything is so so good now I have a loving friends an amazing soul mate getting along with my family I m in college I m getting good grades But every single moment all I can think about is harming myself and ending it Im scared because things are good now and yet I still want to die I always was able to blame my unfortunate circumstances on the suicidal thoughts but now all of it is over and I still want to die I dont even know why I m writing this I guess its because everyone in my life is so proud of me and they think I m doing great and they count on me so much I cant do this anymore Im so sad ,0

Life s too hard to explain why I m sad There s no point to explanation when everyone thinks youre throwing a pity party for yourself Everyone has their own specific personal issues I know too much What s the point I m not gonna get what I want there s too many things to take into consideration and people don t think about those things Life is left up to circumstance I control my fate no one else I could choose to shoot myself tomorrow People will never understand when you know too much about yourself and your surroundings You know how people can be The people who live around you act a certain way together like a hive mind Not everyone but a lot That s when I lose hope It s like digging for a hay in a stack of needles its not worth the pain of trying Its better to leave that stack of needles so you can look for a haystack and find that needle Things are better if I leave ,0

Last year I went through some horrible interpersonal shit on top of the pandemic This ended up triggering a massive bout of depression I was suicidal from May 2020 to September which was a brief respite and then again from October until May I was still horribly depressed in June but I didn t want to kill myself I got put on venlafaxine at the end of June and have been titrating up since My mood has increased a noticeable amount and while I still feel depressed I think things are finally looking up But for some reason it feels as though I don t want that or as if I should still be so deeply depressed that I want to die Has anyone else experienced this What s the deal I don t understand why I m feeling this way ,0

I just can t take it I been pushed around mental health services being lied to and having my rights violated that certain actions were performed When they have not such as being told I went to a and e because I liked the attention also not having after care when I was Discharge from cahms having to wait 4 months before even referred to the adult team and having to wait 3 more months to wait And being told after a particularly bad episode by the acute mental health team that I should just stop drinking then I was told that a consultant psychiatrist would decide whether I should sectioned but never heard back Then I was just dumped with more medication and having to be visited by the crisis team that I should just distract myself and just expected until to wait for threapy If I could anything without consequences I would fucking kill every single one of them condescending bustards for not giving me proper mental health care and expected to be cool with it,0
But you know what people can only fail becase there really is nothing worth living for nothing that is realistically possible Trying to not fail would be just delaying the disillusion I m not sure what I m doing it feels like I m waiting for the right moment to kill myself It s not normal but I don t get how you can be happy without also being deluded I have dissapointed everyone I have no one besides one close person that I wish stopped caring about me I really want them to leave me alone so I don t have anything to lose That must be so great I could go on a trip see stuff sleep in a tent and maybe kill myself along the way if I felt like it Instead I m stuck in limbo feeling bad for failing to match expectations I don t believe in desparing that I can t ever match my own ,0

I can t balance this please help This post is not for me I am not suicidal I am simply scared and worried One of my friends committed suicide a few hours back He left a note saying that the people he knew are why there is no hope for humanity Now this would normally be bad enough But add this one of my friends guy feels guilty and is talking to me about killing himself His girlfriend is frantically texting me trying to find out what is wrong and I don t know what to say I cannot afford to say the wrong thing because she used to cut and the wrong trigger could ruin my life Another one of my friends is threatening with suicide because his grandmother just died of leukemia and this That covers all the friends that I have can I get advice on what to say to them ,0
I guess in some ways I m doing better than most I still have a job a good job but There s just nothing to live for There s nothing that gives me joy there s nothing that keeps me going except habit and not being able to just go buy a gun and end it all I don t know I have a lot of energy left in me to continue though How do you handle it ,0

This can sometimes be a double edge sword as sometimes both people can make the feeling of depression worse But it is nice to talk to someone who atleast understand the feelings I wonder what it is like to go through life and never have suicide thoughts everyday or extreme hopelessness cross your mind each day Sometimes I wonder whether it makes me strong for still being here and I have a strong will power to cope or a coward for not leaving ,0

I don t have friends and this makes me sad and lonely When I was in high school I had so many friends but then I moved and I was bullied for being different This resulted in me developing social anxiety and depression and also made me forget how to make friends Before I didn t even have to think about how to make friends because it came so naturally but now I find myself analyzing how to make a friendship and yet I still fail at it ,0

Death is the only wayI hate myself beyond any and all comprehension Words can t begin to describe the depths of my hate and anger towards myself My hatred and anger grow with each and every breath I take and the only way to quell them the only thing that will quench them is my death I long to kill myself I long to watch as I slowly and painfully drain the life from my eyes I want to take anything I can wrap around my neck and slowly squeeze the air and life out of me I want to pull harder and harder with each breath I take until there is nothing left I want yo die I need to die I have to die and I have to die right here tonight I will not stop until I m done ,0

Hey guys I hate this feeling of being lonely Just sitting here typing this and hearing nothing but complete silence is torturing me The only breath I hear is my own the white noise of my fan and the occasion car that passes by but nothing else It s been like this for a long time now there s some days where I find something interesting to do to fill the void and others where everything just attacks me at once and I find myself here once again sad and lonely in my bedroom I wanted to talk to someone have somebody know what s currently going through my mind so in the spur of the moment I brought a microphone and plugged it in I pressed record and just laid my thoughts out on a silver platter and posted it on YouTube I don t know if it will help but it does feel nice knowing that someone will hear me if they care to listen I don t know maybe it sounds stupid but I wanted to say something Here s the spiel  ,0
I ve had suicidal thoughts for as long as I could remember I remember writing a suicide note when I was like 6 and trying to run away I m almost 23 now and they just keep getting worse For a while I was really only hanging on because I felt too guilty about what my family would go through but now I m only hanging on for my cat She was abused and mistreated by her previous owners and it took her over a year to warm up to me I can t just leave her without someone that understands her the way I do Sometimes I cry when I think her passing I don t think I ll be able to handle it but for now she s my rock Sorry if this is incoherent I m sad and not having a good time,0

Am coming down from a manic episode afraid I am doomed again I had a bad phase last month where I nearly killed myself ended up in a psych ward and got out 11 days later After getting out I had some new appreciation for everything I could see I was excitable at work happy to wake up insanely energetic and even felt like I could happily do something like break my arm Just to pass time if i was bored I actually wanted to it felt exciting I ve never experience something like that before but it felt so good As of this week I can feel my energy getting lower and lower I dont feel excited dont enjoy things dont feel powerful and some bad thoughts are beginning to come back I feel like I am going on a downward spiral that will just end in another hospital visit or death ,0
I know I post a lot here and don t respond but I do appreciate peoples responses lately I ve just given up on life I do things still but I don t want to bother with people most of the time they just hurt me or make me feel bad my own mum told me how people have it worse and I know it s nothing mean but it hurt so much to hear that I know my life is amazing compared to others but I ain t happy I don t enjoy life or what I do with my life I just feel like none realises what I deal with on a daily basis because of my own mind and it hurts more then anything my mum doesn t want me around anymore really and I don t blame her but she was never there for me when I needed it most and I think that s partly why I m not ok and I don t think she realises it,0
The Infinite BlackThat s what I call it anyway I could be wrong about the afterlife but I prefer post death being kind of what it was like before we were born Just nothing Pure peace Nothing weighing you down and nothing pulling you up Just infinite impenetrable black So welcoming to accept you into the arms of infinity No more humiliation failures or feelings of inadequacy No more being alone and hating that you aren t worth anyone s time Just absofuckinglutely nothing If the void had a prayer I d say it every single day If suicide had a saint I d whisper her name with my hands clasped together in front of my face I want it so bad ,0

I m sorry for disappearingI m sorry to the people I ve gotten to know through chat here who just saw me disappear and wondered if I d ended my life The truth is while I m battling suicidal impulses almost daily the main reason I m not active on this account is shame Shame for writing all these raw posts about my depression self harm suicidal fantasies and how pathetic and attention seeking I probably appear I come on here to vent to say things I d never normally be able to and once I m done I hide away Pretend it didn t happen pretend it wasn t me pretend I m a normal person who doesn t cut themselves and want to die I ve been ashamed of my mental illness as long as I ve had it so most of my life and I probably will always be I want to thank every single person who s reached out and started a conversation all you beautiful caring empathetic people I don t know that I can make it but I hope with everything I have that you can persevere Thank you Reddit ,0

About 3 months ago I finally decided to go to the doctor by reccomendation of my relative after another heavy depressive episode It was just one visit and after that I stopped going because of workload at my university I felt I couldn t keep up I know I shouldn t expect miracles after one visit but even this one felt so incredibly hard I didn t know how to describe my feelings why I wanted to die or should I even share too much details of my life I was also prescribed antidepressants for a month but i don t think it helped Now I m at rock bottom again and want to start my visits again but I don t know I m afraid I m just helpless and I m stuck being miserable for life And the guilt that these visits are being paid from my parents pockets doesn t help ,0

Just a rant life summary suicidal thoughts When I was about 11 I tried to kill myself awful parents awful house awful third world country and for that I was beaten up pretty bad by my dad I m now almost 17 and I see no point in life and no reason to keep going on No one loves me at all Not at home not in the world and that will probably never change I guess that being an artist I was born with the predisposition to be sad I feel and know that my art will never be good enough for anyone to pay me for it and I cannot see myself doing anything else for a living And now what What s the point To maybe go around and exist because living is DEFINITELY not something I ve experienced before having a miserable routine in a job that I hate Or to go and try to follow my dream and end up even more miserable for not being able to even give myself some sort of materialistic pleasure I just wanna die I see no option No perspective of future happiness I ve never felt that Happiness And I just can t do it anymore ,0
Just venting do not respond I have no empathy left I could never form any close relationship due to maternal abandonment at a very early age I have strong narc traits and the meds are not doing anything since I never had a chem imbalance just no girlfriend Girls were attracted 2 me but I rejected them bc of my mother s decision to place me in kindergarten at age 1 Now Now I can t match on any dating app since I have no prospects or anything else that women find attractive And they are pickier than ever in 2020 since attractive men are choosing to fuck 100s of decent looking girls rather than marrying one good woman from the get go My only cope is to not think and when it fails this happens not that it s negative or that I am dissatisfied with my situation I do not exist I am a part of a brain that will disolve quickla and have already shifted shapes billions of times ,0

Ive ended up minamising my past sexual trauma to the point where I m not sure if I even deserve the right to be effected the way I was and still am Even when people knew it was never given the right amount of care People just moved on after a week or two and I m still left suffering from it over a year later It s just got to the point where I m almost convincing myself that I don t have any right to feel how I do I really wish I was just given the same care that majority of people who go through what I do are It s not fair man,0

Please no judgment of what I will write in this thread I m just a guy trying desperately to help his loved one I ve been with my fianc for almost 5 years now Never have I felt the need to ask for outside help as I have a good understanding of depression myself but not this bad Recently she has lost her job As of right now I m the only one working between the two of us and it s never been harder to try and juggle between work and being there for her Anyone who has lost a job before especially with depression you know what it can do to you She s never felt so helpless She even admitted to wanting to cut again which is close to her worst mental state I wanna somehow motivate her to help her look for a job on her own without needing me to be there for her to be okay I wanna be there for her every minute of every day so bad but I know I can t It s starting to affect my own mental state and reaching out seems like a better idea than attempting to injure myself with overtime hours for extra money ,0
The tree that lies too much in one direction easily snaps Don t be hard on yourself forgive yourself and love yourself first Don t overwork yourself take care of your health If you don t stand up for yourself and set boundaries then you will grow resentful and that will show in other more nasty ways Don t try to change people because it doesn t work always accept and acknowledge and feel your feelings even if it scares you slowly and gently change your thoughts into more positive ones with compassion and love Do what will make you happy in the moment let the future worry about itself You don t have to try to find words or an explanation to explain why you are sad you don t have to convince anyone because what you feel is real You don t have to treat people well or hang out with them if you don t want to if people make you feel confused or bad about yourself then leave them you deserve more than that Do stretching exercises to remove the pain and tension from your upper back and shoulders ,0

I have been battling depression since I was a child long back story and have managed to get through tough episodes with the help of exercise and creative outlets However this past year has put me into a very tough state of mind to get out of made worse by the pandemic I ve had mental breakdowns that have led me to almost commit suicide within the past 6 months as well But on top of that I am engaged to someone with ADHD and it s also been difficult to cope with his symptoms He is an amazing man and goes the extra mile for me always but It s hard for me to show my appreciation with my depression and also not build resentment against him because of how he is as a person with ADHD talks over me forgets details constantly doesn t really listen to me and does something else while I m in mid sentence I just need advice on how to manage a healthy relationship I think because both of our mental illnesses are starting to ruin our relationship ,0

I want to die but I can tI can t do it and it pains me Im so fucking tired of all the bullshit Friends saying I m attractive saying I m boyfriend material but nothing ever happening because I m awkward and potentially autistic Can someone put a bullet in my head since I can t do it myself I m just tired and in mental pain ,0
I think I ve decided how to do itI ve been going through another bad patch and I don t know if I can keep going but my main reason not to so far is I can t figure out how to do it without fucking someone else up in the process Inevitably someone s got to find me but I want to do it in a way that ll be quick but not traumatise someone else and I think I ve figured it out At least this way my parents won t know I meant to do it and have to deal with that afterwards Just another week till I can I still feel shitty beyond belief but at least it s nearly over ,0

Staying around for family Anyone else have this thought I don t necessarily want to careen off of a cliff to end it all but really the only thing keeping me around is because of the pain it would cause my family I m sure this same thought has been posted 100x over but I realized it on my way home from work I don t have anything to live for Every day is getting up for work so that I can pay for rent loans debt and stick around long enough for my family to die off I m just so fucking bored with life and might join the military just for the chance to die honorably Anyways first post rant ,0
Is suicide ever the right answer I know this is a suicide prevention subreddit but I want to hear takes on this Say someone is an awful person and hurt a lot of people and likely won t change not a murderer or rapist but still a really bad person Would suicide be right in this situation to prevent harm to more people ,0

I was doing mentally great for a max of 2 months but the moment I start actually getting into a relationship having a good environment at work and having a better relationship with my family and friends I start to go back to being depressed again I keep thinking that things are only good temporarily and that things aren t going to last much longer whether that s my relationship my job friends ect I feel very lost and I feel horrible about myself that I m thinking this way but it s difficult to get out of this mindset and I know that thinking this way only causes more problems than they are worth ,0

So i just moved out from my moms house and my home town after 22 yrs And as much as i like it i am also anxious and stressed It s probably because i have a puppy 9 months which i brought with me it is mine afterall But since it s my first dog ever and my first time ever moving out i am very overwhelmed I had depression long before i moved out or got a dog aswell When i was home in my hometown i felt less stressed because of much less responsibility now i have work i have my dog rent to pay bills food expenses and gas for my car I have exams in 3 months which i need for my apprenticeship where i work I am so stressed and overwhelmed and idk what to do I feel like i m going to get very mentally ill if i keep feeling like this for a long time Also i am living underneath the people i pay rent to they have a dog too and whenever he barks my dog will also bark i feel like im failing to train my dog correctly aswell because of this ,0

 UPDATE I m a cop I shouldn t want to end it So I went to the doctor this week after making my last post Doc was concerned because one of my complaints was severe headaches though I have never regularly had them before She ordered bloodwork and a CT scan Scan came back okay but it turns out for some reason I had a very low level of potassium Turns out 3 5 is considered low and I had a level hovering about 2 9 Doc said this could lead to depression and affect my strength I m on some medicine for now and I feel a lot better about life Thank you all I know better now than to act macho when my body is trying to tell me something ,0
Some days I feel like I m getting better Other days I hope that I might disappear if I m lucky I love my life but I think I hate myself I feel like nothing I do is good enough or worth anything I feel like my son doesn t love me I feel like I m not my own person like my life doesn t matter I m just a support character for whoever I m around I don t have someone I can talk to I don t know what else to say How do pull yourself out of a hole like this I m so tired ,0
I wonder if us who look at life from this persolective are missing some crucial point or if it s all other people who are not depressed and much happier than us who miss a point Thoughts I also like that the common consensus is that suicide is irrational stupid impulsive abd ultimately comes from an unhealthy mind but rather than to live in a world like this isn t it the logical conclusion to just do the only thing in your power to stop it for you at least Or should we just work as slaves and still be seen by everyone as miserable and whatnot for the sake of the few lucky people who were born in a way to benefit from this system and be happy with it ,0
 I have done self harm in the past I am almost 1 month sober I don t really want to hurt myself Sometimes I am cooking and I will be cutting something and I want to see how sharp it is so I think about cutting myself it isn t for coping I just get curious There are other example I just can t think of any right now I am planning to talk to my therapist but it is really confusing me ,0
If you can just talk in dms,0
Hello When I was a little girl I was thinking about the purpose of this life Everything seemed gray for the most time I couldn t understand how other people were happy when I just didn t care I do care about many things but for the most part it feels as if I have a cloud over my head even when I was little Now I am a grown up and I believe and feel still the same I thought that this will change but it hasn t I am tired There is no fighting because this is me empty and sad and lost and tired and weak etc ,0
I ve struggled with depression since I was an adolescent I ve self medicated for years to deal with it I just always have a feeling of emptiness that never goes away it just temporarily gets filled with other things Sometimes I ll have a day or two when I m ok but most of the time my life is just getting through whatever it is I m doing and then making it to the next task day Lately I ve had suicidal ideation I m not considering suicide whatsoever but I ve had ideations I want to get help However when I tried therapy in the past I had poor experiences My last therapist told me there was nothing wrong with me and told me I was doing just fine after about 6 sessions I m just tired of feeling this way I don t know what kind of therapist to seek out Is there some kind of website that patients use to review mental health professionals or do I just kind of have to pick a name off the list from my insurance company and take it from there Thank you very much for the help ,0

Today I am proud to say I will be leaving this groupTwo months ago I was heavily suicidal waking up in a panic every hour or so each night looking at each pole on my drive to work thinking of how tempting it would be to drive into each one slightly swerving off the road before quickly getting a grip of myself Broken relationships broken work ethic surrounded by depressed people self harming for the first time in my life bottling up my emotions until I d bleed them out Time really does heal all wounds my mind is clear nowadays and I have an appreciation towards this weird life thing I ve been given I love listening to music working out playing games hanging out with friends making money etc it s all a blessing Thank you all who helped me in times of need I will stay in touch with some of you ,0

I think we need to get back to our roots Work for things that matter not for materialistic items Establish communities that help us learn to farm and take care of our essential needs ourselves The internet has gone too far and we need to establish real life human contact Everything is too fake ,0

If I get help under my parent s insurance will my parents be notified I ve wanted to die since high school I m about to graduate college and move out on my own and this will be my first opportunity to seek professional help without my parents finding out However I will still be under my parents health insurance USA If I attempt to get help and have the provider bill my parents insurance will my parents be notified that I am seeking treatment or otherwise able to find out Having them find out about my state of mind is a fate I consider worse than death Thanks ,0
I hate that I can t talk about my problems to my friends or family Most of them say they want to help but when things start to get too real for them they no longer want to listen Once you mention suicide they no longer want to be there The worst part is that when if I actually did go through with it they would be the first people to say if only he reached out for help I just want someone to try to understand what I feel and where I come from I just want my family to understand or at least attempt to understand Does anyone else feel this way Are your families comfortable with listening to you ,0
I don t know what to do with my emotion I think this is the worst feeling I ever had since I for the first time slicing my skin with a razor just to feel that I can feel something It seems like pain is the only feeling I can feel Even though I smile and respond positively to others that for some reason need my respond I feel dead inside ,0
Im going to stream myself hurting myselfGoing to stream my suicide,0

It s late again And in this hot night I m obviously having a beer drinking thoughts Imagine that there is perfect person for every thing you do Perfect person for hugs perfect person that gives dad jokes or having a dark humor as you perfect person for quality talks perfect person for butterflies in your belly These persons exists but it s very rarely to find atleast 3 perfect things in one person Humans that have soul urges to have these things in life And it s very sad that not everyone gets it Yes When you feel sad in heart you one someone to hug you someone to talk to someone to laugh with and someone to rely on Maybe just buy a dog Or few dogs ,0
 F19 I won t sugar coat it I ve been depressed and suicidal for years now and it just keeps getting worse I so badly want to work on my health mindfulness etc to maybe bring myself out of this very bad episode I ve been in for a while I sit around all day thinking about either taking my life or finding some way to change myself but I have nothing in me to actually do it I walk my dog everyday but even when I m out I am in a fog I have insanely bad self esteem I m so self destructive but inside I don t want to be My family has gotten tired of me so I don t even talk about it anymore I ve tried therapy and one kind of meds neither helped very much I feel really angry at myself Where do I start I m so lost ,0
The scariest part of all this to me is how intrusive it can be and how easily you can think of everything negative ,0
Can we atleast have special quota of special jobs for people with depression ,0
yes you Life has been hard lately hasn t it But we have these sections and you noticed right Everyone here understands each other Thank you for being part of it Without you and all the others this community wouldn t have existed We wouldn t have been able to help each other the way we can now And when the day comes you leave our community i hope that you aren t sad and confused anymore Or maybe you could stay to encourage others to the point where you would be Thanks to everyone for making a place for us to stay ,0

The negative thoughts have been really strong lately constantly telling me how worthless I am reminding me of the mistakes I ve made in my live and how my future is going to be hopeless These thoughts are all consuming and they are eating me alive When I m in such a state the only thing that provides me some comfort are suicidal thoughts It relieves me to think about how I could just step out of this life and end the pain Suicidal thoughts used to scare me but not anymore They tend to calm me down now thinking I will be at peace when I will finally do it ,0
This place is hell and I m being punished so all pain and suffering experienced is justified I guess maybe if I convince myself hard enough that ll actually become my reality something anything to fill the hole It s all too painfully empty I can t even hate it I can t do anything but distract myself I miss that kid,0
a rematch ,0
I might kill some people you knowNot saying I will but you know who knows what future holds,0
And now I ve just found out that shes already with someone after just a month It s like I It doesnt even phase her,0
One step to ODI had an exam today that I was freaking out about I had really bad panic attack so I considered taking my clonazepam except that I took more than I should have supposed to take 2 mg per day but took 3 mg at one dose I felt really woozy and just off balance I ended up going to the hospital and got discharged instead of being admitted in the psych ward but I think I m going to have to admit myself soon Just not at this hospital The last one I stayed at was good but they don t take my insurance All I know is that if I don t do anything about it now I ll end up taking a fatal dose sometime in the future ,0
regardless of what happens from this point on i know my end game is suicide for some major reasons id rather not share i already know that regardless of any actions i take from here til my death or what i do it wont alter end game for me too much has happened that simply cannot be fixed its just a rlly weird thought i guess it could be in 5 yrs or 10 but at the end of the day i already know how i will die ,0
And that s why I struggle so hard to talk about my intense suicidal thoughts The person is always gonna try to help me But there s nothing you can do and that just worsen things I just wanna end things right now and that doesn t matter if I m still young I have no future ,0
You used to care how you look you make friends so easily all you had to do was ask everything was so nice back then,0
Ty for posting this reading the guidelines made me understand myself a lot more and i don t feel like complete garbarge anymore It s rough have a nice day my friends,0
The tree that lies too much in one direction easily snaps Don t be hard on yourself forgive yourself and love yourself first Don t overwork yourself take care of your health If you don t stand up for yourself and set boundaries then you will grow resentful and that will show in other more nasty ways Don t try to change people because it doesn t work always accept and acknowledge and feel your feelings even if it scares you slowly and gently change your thoughts into more positive ones with compassion and love Do what will make you happy in the moment let the future worry about itself You don t have to try to find words or an explanation to explain why you are sad you don t have to convince anyone because what you feel is real You don t have to treat people well or hang out with them if you don t want to if people make you feel confused or bad about yourself then leave them you deserve more than that Do stretching exercises to remove the pain and tension from your upper back and shoulders ,0
Every second I m awake I feel like crying ,0

I think when most people talk about modern society they re really talking about the culture more than the geopolitical aspect of things Some of it is valid some of it not so much I for one think some aspects of modern life can certainly be blamed on certain groups of people who choose to live a certain way and other aspects aren t too big of a deal ,0
Please make it stop please make the pain stopI can t stop crying I just want to be held right now Please make these thoughts go away please something help,0
I ve spent the last three years recovering from a major depressive episode I m finally off medication and it feels kind of like a layer of bubblewrap has been taken off It has also brought on some unresolved trauma I thought these were feelings of the past that I had gotten over but I guess not I m scared of talking to my family about this because they would be worried just not sure where to turn,0
 So I was playing a Team Fortress 2 map on casual I have been playing this game for about 5 years and I still suck at the game at times and sometimes do to my family s internet and my crappy intel laptop I would lag I saw videos of people telling their problems on here so I thought I should give it a try I m a 17 year old guy doing my last year of high school I have autism and I prefer to be treated like a normal person and to get not pity for having autism But what happened was that this guy who ill keep anonymous He was saying I was bad and just being harsh about it giving me nothing but destructive criticism x200B I use this game as a coping mechanism and it works a lot I just need some support and motivation right now and would appreciate not looking this guy up because I already reported him for abusing the in game kick system and harassment ,0
I live alone My depression is at an all time high I believe I m just not worth it anymore and I ve finally given up on myself I wake up alone I do everything on my own Any fun activities that i truly enjoy doing nobody wants to do them with me But if it s anyone else that wants to do something they want to do i am always there for it Nobody is there for me But I m there for everyone else I m just another person that people can walk over I just want a genuine friendship with people and a genuine love life But i seem to get the short end of the stick every time Nice guys finish last it happens time and time again I hate it here I just want to the pain to go away ,0
I know hurt everyone and push them away but I don t care about life anymore I don t care what happens it doesn t matter one way or another I ll end up dead so what s the point,0
I m 31 years old and my sister who is 5 years younger than me is moving into her new home with her new husband They got married in October on the day that I always wanted to get married but that s another story and she s been with him since she was 17 I m very excited for her I really am but the sadness I feel right now about it all is majorly overpowering that I am divorced and had to move back home a year and a half ago I have a mediocre career that pays decent but not decent enough to live out on my own Basically I feel like I ve failed I m watching my little sister move on and forward in her life with such positivity and I m stuck here 31 Single Living at home with no signs that I ll be able to move back out anytime soon It s so hard to keep that flight attendant smile on my face sometimes when all I really want to do is break down and say I m so happy for you I really really am but it s so hard to watch you get to make all of these life changes I ve always wanted for myself ,0
I really hate this world Look at the news you will ONLY see suffering and pain The only time I will get some drops of happiness is when I take drugs and I know very well that s not the way 90 of people are pieces of shits Sometimes I just hope that I when I sleep that I won t wake up I always thought I m not depressed because I m not sad but I m actually not feeling anything at all I m dull The years of of heavy drug abuse left me scarred and it s hard to accept but it s the truth The society that we all live in is pure bullshit and I hate almost everyone I know to some degree Im always wearing a mask when I m with my friends and they would never know I m feeling like this Fuck the world and everyone ,0
Medical studentCan t deal with the absurdity of it all So envious of the people who don t contemplate their existence Fortunate enough to not really have to try and I am at the top of my class Scored 99th percentile on our national boards This means I probably could do any specialty in medicine and train at some of the best institutions in the world and go on to make significant wealth The cruel thing is I just don t care I want to but I can t It means nothing Wish I could just transfer everything over to a student that wants to continue with this life Guess I ll trod on for now ,0

So about a year ago I had made a post on this sub reddit about how I felt like ending it all and now I just was thinking back and wanted to make an update I am starting therapy next Wednesday and my gf makes me actually feel happy I actually truly want to get better now and I think I m finally getting on that path And I also wanted to say thank you so so so much to everyone who gave me advice and kind words it means so much to me so again thank you to everyone who helped Now just because I am getting help now doesnt mean I m fully better I still think about cutting and ending it a lot but I am slowly getting better Thanks everyone I love you all and my dms are always open 3,0
I want to do it Please help me About five years ago I lived with a narcissistic mom who was physically abusive as well as emotionally It took a huge toll on me and left some pretty horrible scars both inside and out It really messed me up I tried to commit suicide three times while I was living with her Each time I screwed up somehow I m not even strong enough to put an end to it all But every fiber of my being is telling me to try again even though I ve gotten away from her Because of her I absolutely hate myself and everything about me and I don t think that I deserve to live But to be honest I m scared The past three times hurt so badly that I don t want to try again and I don t want to die But I can t see any other way out of this mess I need help ,0

I ll keep this as short as I can Sorry if its the wrong place for this So today I woke up and just felt odd I didn t feel much emotion but I sat there for 2 hours after waking up just looking every now and again at my phone then I realised I ve not moved so I got up and got ready for the day etc After I got to work I just suddenly felt sad and down I m not sure what caused it if anything but now I m feeling a bit meh I tried hiding it from everyone at work so I didn t drag anyone down with me but now its late and I m just in my feels ya know I m just curious if anyone else has felt like this and if there s a way to deal with it ,0
I feel that i m more useful than likableI feel that people see me as a smart person but they not really friends they prefer to be friends with other people and i m never the best friend of someone i always felt like i m some kind of people that is useful when you need but not when you wanna hang out or talk maybe i m being too paranoid idk,0

I have the most supportive parents I could ask for they do everything for me Yet the best I could do for them is stay in bed and not kill myself what a waste of energy for them I m such a burden I can t do anything right I m so fucking useless and costly I wish I could go back in time and somehow stop my birth from happening that would save them the pain of having to deal with a pisslow child I guess the best course of action now is to die for the sake of everybody around me and myself Someday when I have it in me I might hang myself in a ravine I used to like walking down I don t see any downsides my parents being able to focus on the kid that matters more money etc And I am free from the pain ,0
Okay so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesn t mix well when you re already depressed but I wouldn t think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad Long story short went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got It was fun these are people I like and things were starting to get a bit better for me Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic found an advisor for my master s thesis But at a certain point maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped I just wasn t there I left didn t say goodbye to anyone attempted to bike home and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike I m usually a little bit of an emotional drunk but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them It s never been this I ve never felt this outside of my own experience Thoughts ,0
No matter how calm and stoic i try to remain i can t stop pretty much shaking inside There is this anger and fight in my head after this one innocent question Maybe that s because I m still in the closet but i feel like people are secretly judging me and laughing at me when once again I m like Not yet I start to feel kinda isolated and different from everybody It s even worse when they re like Are you getting laid this weekend And i have to be like Yeah sure but i cringe inside and it probably shows even tho i m laughing and smiling And they start to talk to each other about you know what I feel like this is the one thing most straight guys in my workplace can bond over and i just can t fit in It s like that even with older guys The conversation can go pretty smoothly but after this one question it gets so awkward maybe just in my head I know i can and probably should always play along but it s gets so annoying after some time Any advice on that Sorry for my english ,0
Talked to a loved one and things actually worked out but now I don t know what to doSo I do this thing every year or so where I tell my family about my struggle with suicide even though I expect the same answer that I m weak minded and that the bible will fix everything I know I m still juvenile because I need my family for validation but I don t know I guess I m grasping for straws looking for anything to stop me from going over the edge But today my mother was supportive and listened she doesn t get it but she s trying her best to understand amp x200B I ve been desperately wanting to get better but I m sitting in this grey area where I m not in an immediate crisis but I know shit will go down the next time I bug out I want to get better but I m scared I m gonna purposefully fuck everything up to the point of no return and I don t know where to start getting help amp x200B Is there an online support group for this stuff I live in a rural area and I don t want to show face ,0

Will someone please just talk to me I have been experiencing a lot of dissociative symptoms lately Sometimes it takes me several hours upon awakening to figure out the basics if my life Other times I feel like I m not in the real world but somewhere else Often I m not really anywhere I have enough sense right now to know that I m headed down a really bad path I packed a few things left home and am on my phone in an empty parking lot I don t know what I m doing or why or even know for sure when it is but I have some not good stuff with me This is the start of a pattern I have that s really self destructive and that often ends in something traumatic Will someone please just be there for me so I am distracted and don t do anything stupid ,0
I feel like shit when I think about it A lot of years ago when i was 8 or 9 YO i was playing with my neighbour 12 YO in the garden Our parents werent paying attention to us my neighbour took me to a little Cabin in the garden and then he put his pants off to show me his Penis He wanted me to touch it but I didnt do it later he asked me if he could see mine Fortunately my mother called us and nothing hapenned at the moment I didnt feel uncomfortable but some years later i realized how Creeppy it was I lost contact with my neighbour some months after that when his extremely religious family sent him to a militar school and then moved out of the city Due to his angry issues and some other symptons i think that he was developing some kind of schizophrenia As a kid i was very shy and passive so im pretty sure that after insisting more i would have done whatever he wanted That s why i feel like shit when i think about it i was a very innocent boy ,0

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and chronic major depression I m basically a crazy bridge burner during my episodes For a while I honestly thought I was getting better I m taking my meds managing my mood swings and enjoying my time alone mainly because I stayed away from forming friendships expecting the cycle to happen all over again e g losing friends and burning bridges during an episode But then an ex friend from the past messages me and is pretty much hell bent on bringing me down Virgos can be vicious Now I m just done having a cry fest for an hour and telling myself I m a horrible human being and just wanting to die Sometimes just sometimes I wish I had a friend I could tell that I m suffering That I m sad I m scared I m lonely and that I wish I was dead I don t need comforting words telling me I ll be okay and it ll get better I just want someone to listen and know that I m in pain ,0

Seems to happen a lot in team environments or workplaces It becomes a regular occurrence where coworkers will come to you with their grievances about another person and it s been said that if people talk shit about others to you they probably talk shit about you to others as well For some reason its never bothered me to think about that that up in the air unconfirmed knowledge of someone saying bad things about you But then someone lets it slip in conversation that some thoughts concerning you that you were unaware of have been passed around That part absolutely sucks knowing something s happening but not the specifics of it or how people actually feel about you now ,0
I m so shocked that I made it to 21 but also disappointedthe older I get the consequences of committing suicide get worse Like sometimes I just wish that I had done it right the first time when I was 13 because my world was so much smaller my little sister was only 3 But now she s almost 12 there s way more people to consider and I can t do that to my sister but the pain is unimaginable I feel like there s a tiny thread holding me to staying alive but I m so close to snapping I just wish there was an easier way to do it but I guess I m grateful that there s no painless way because if there was an easy way I d be dead already and people around me would be traumatized It s just so frustrating because it feels like I have to go through so much pain every day just to not traumatize people in my life but why is it fair that I have to live in constant pain I just wish I could get euthanized by a doctor easily and painlessly FUCK sorry i realize my rant is all over the place but so am i lmao ,0

So this isn t really a question or anything just something I think about sometimes that I wanted to put out there I realised a while ago that to love someone is to know them I know this has been said several times but still It s knowing small things about people and loving them because of that and paying attention to those things in order to make them happy And I realised that no one will ever love me because they don t know anything about me and they never will because I am nothing I m not nothing but I like nothing I can t talk about anything and I feel like I can t get interested in anything no matter how hard I try I feel like because of this no one will ever love me and I m trying to be okay with that but I m just not ,0

I guess I should start by explaining that I m 13 almost 14 and live with my abusive single mother my parents got divorced after I was born lmao She also suffers with depression and I ve seen her taking meds before Our relationship is really rocky and she s usually really manipulative towards me When it comes down to it I m just tired I have no drive to keep living Struggling through every single day has worn on me and now I ve finally collapsed My other friends are starting to get jobs and are talking about school while I can hardly get the strength to shower or brush my hair most days All I ve been doing is filling my days with meaningless hobbies and feeling bad for myself I feel pathetic and lazy I know I won t be able to even start thinking about getting better for at least five more years I don t know what I m gonna do I think I m just a lost cause edit spelling errors,0
I can t seem to enjoy anything anymore Everything is boring and colorless even the things I used to love All I can think about is how life is so hard Why should I keep working for the rest of my life everyday nonstop just to do die in the end I don t think life is worth living anymore Those ideas are eating me everyday and I don t even have enough money to go to a therapist they are really expensive where I live I m exhausted really really exhausted ,0
Practically every day I see posts on social media from those looking for their answers to this and very similar questions many from the context of having done a great deal of reflection through the Covid crisis and now as we hopefully begin to emerge in to a new and changed reality Wellbeing psychology and the solution focused approach have a huge amount to offer in this respect and I m currently considering the feasibility of PERMA Hypnotherapy offering a program to meet this end combining the best from these areas to give a structured approach and an outcome that is a clear understanding of this is what I am this is what my life is about here is what I am going to do and why and this is my legacy to the world It would be interesting to hear if there is a demand for such a program and if so what specifically would you like to see ,0

These thoughts are coming backI have anger issues I ve known from the first argument I ve had this year I didn t realize it before but even the slightest thing ticks me off The people I start an argument with I can feel myself burning with rage Keep in mind this anger has built up from every little negative part of my life I go through it be negative then I forget it But the anger is still there And as much as I want to I can t release it all at once Most of my friends don t understand it Every argument with them adds more and more to this growing pile I ve stopped at the edge of a building before contemplating it but decided not to Because I still have people that need me that I still have something to live for I enjoy and hate my anger When I m angry raging I lose any sense of human and let my anger control me I ve had better control over it recently in these past weeks but sometimes it isn t steady And I m kind of glad I found a sub like this where I can rant about this ,0
Sorry for your loss At least you two shared your lives together and both of you had eachother and made eachother happy You have those memories forever She knows you loved her Loosing a pet is worse than losing a friend family member in my opinion ,0
Especially with these cookie cutter therapies trying to deal with everyone at once Need therapy Do group therapy Or do an 8 week program That ll fix everything s,0
do you enjoy anything anymore even if its the smallest most impossible thing like does a massage at a resort in hawaii sound nice or is it that you couldnt care less,0
Why I am not good at life I do not get along well with people I am terribly awkward and I loathe myself I wish I didn t feel this way Sometime soon I will finally do it I will end it all because it s too hard I can t drive I m terrified of it I tell people it s because I m a bad driver or that it s just a scary concept That s half true but the reality is that I m terrified that I will purposefully crash I will drive into a tree or off a bridge or into oncoming traffic so that I will die Why do I get these thoughts in my head Why am I constently telling myself that I am awful and ugly and that nobody loves me Why do I sit in front of the mirror for hours crying at my reflection clutching on to a bottle of pills before remembering that s a terrible way to go Why I wish I understood I wish I could tell someone A mind is not meant to think this way ,0
Yeah unfortunately this is the mood,0
I was doing mentally great for a max of 2 months but the moment I start actually getting into a relationship having a good environment at work and having a better relationship with my family and friends I start to go back to being depressed again I keep thinking that things are only good temporarily and that things aren t going to last much longer whether that s my relationship my job friends ect I feel very lost and I feel horrible about myself that I m thinking this way but it s difficult to get out of this mindset and I know that thinking this way only causes more problems than they are worth ,0
i want someone to kill me i want to die no more thinking no more moving no more feelingd nothing,0
I m just sick of everythingLife is boring I don t have any friends to make it bearable It s the same thing over and over again everyday I m never going to contribute to society so I don t see the point of going on living like this ,0
I can t tell if I m finally dying or not but I feel badI m a 15 y o female who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 4 3 years now I was recently diagnosed with OCD and my psychiatrist has been thinking I might be developing bipolar but since I m so young he isn t too sure about it yet Last night ish I decided to take my normal medicine prazosin fluvoxamine and sertraline more than I should have with that and then took a lot of gaunfacine that I had left over from when I was prescribed it for anxiety but then taken off of it cause it cause my new one didn t want me on ADHD medicine Sound has become really distorted I feel like I m in a weird outer body state my vision seems awful and I don t know if I should tell my mom to take me to the hospital Part of me wants to let myself die but the other part wants me to go to the hospital to make sure I don t leave my best friend boyfriend ,0
Razor sharp nightNo one cares about me but why would they I m a big failure and stupid imbecile It doesn t matter if I try to stay positive and try to make everything better I always end up here alone crying and harming myself I want everything to just stop Well not everything only myself my life I want it to end Might do it soon ,0

Right now I am just so low so often that everything feels hopeless Been out of high school for a year and I have no aspirations nobody I truly feel comfortable around no personality outside of my mental illness and in general just a lot of self hatred Everytime I get scared or say something wrong my mind goes immediately to suicide but I know I can t do that because I couldn t put my parents in the position to find me or go through that grief I don t know what else to do with my life than wait for an okay time to end it I don t know what will help Sorry if this all sounds pathetic ,0
This is literally the post I came here to write ,0
So i had bad Grades in school and i got a talk with my parents they told me to try more so i did i wanted to make them proud but when i actually got better and instead of 3 c s and 6 b s i had 9 b s which is better right and i bring the report card home and my mom looks at it and doesnt even say nothing She looked so disapointed and when i asked why she started comparing my Grades to what grades my older sisters had and when she was done she got up and just left the room its been 18 days since this conversation and im still sad i cry almost every time i remember it I feel like shes not proud of me ,0
This is starting to get so frustrating and exhausting I just never feel any positive emotions I don t even remember the last time I felt happy and content with my life Laughing is always fake I don t recall bursting out with laughter in many years I just feel like I am always faking a smile and fake laughing I feel so empty and dull inside What also annoys me is that I don t have a reason to feel this way My life is in a pretty good position right now but still I just don t feel anything positive It s always sadness exhaustion and jealousy Just negative emotions This has been going for years ,0
Not even considering my open affairs like my student debt and that I can pay rent and feed myself Got a job and alive and loving parents So why do I feel the way I do I shouldn t There are enslaved nations and poverty and irreversible environmental damage and everything s fucked but I feel sad and want to die and can t get over it It s goddamn bullshit Like it s not fair to anyone else struggling with depression and that ,0
 No matter what there are things that I feel that I have no way of expressing I don t know what to say but I need to say something to keep myself from exploding I ve been suicidal for a while I attempted a couple years ago but I was stopped by a close friend He was concerned but I somehow convinced him that it was just because I was drunk the alcohol might have had some role that time but it was not the only thing that caused me to want to jump off a balcony I m thankful for him because he cared but I just didn t feel like I was worth the concern I still don t I ve fought with my head for a long time and I m convinced that the fight never ends I want to give up so badly I m fucked up I m not worth the fight If I could go without hurting anyone else I would ,0
People like that should be avoided as much as possible honestly it s messed up how someone who is supposed to love you can write your depression off as a choice my mom is the same way so I don t even talk to her about my problems of any sort anymore if I do I feel worse than I did before or at best get the same old useless repetitive crap about how I choose for my life to be the way it is smh Some people just shouldn t be allowed to have kids seriously you should be required to take some sort of test and given a mental evaluation before you are allowed to bring kids into the world ,0
And now suicide seems like a great fucking idea once again I feel like the dumbest motherfucker in the world right now For being interested in a soon to be dead fucking nation such as Japan And if you shot me in the head for being a fucking weeaboo I d fucking deserve it for being such a fucking dumbass And now suicide seems good right now again Fuck this damn life of mine Again I wish it wasn t so fucking hard ,0
Close to the edgeThe constant and monotone esc phrases of It ll get better are starting to do nothing Just the same lies spewed at me And nobody brings up actual evidence to disprove the fact that my death wouldn t mean anything in the grand scheme of the world and the people around me I m supposed to be a faint life that just dies It s like going back to what I was supposed to be Nothing Nonexistent And I just need to get the courage and willpower to grab that knife and cut deep deep deep into my body Red and all And I feel like I KNOW that I m close to the edge ,0
I m such a big piece shitI should just get eat by fly just like a usefull piece of shit,0
Is anyone here willing to give me motivation to commit Like just check in every few days to remind me that it s hopeless and give me some encouragement to do the right thing Cheers ,0
It s as the title says I feel so empty inside and I feel like everything I do is just pointless I m an ambitious person but why Why should I be So I can finally be happy I would rather be rich and sad than poor and sad but in both cases I m still sad On the surface I tell myself that I should do these things to be rich and successful and happy I just have to not be happy to get there I don t want to suffer now so that I can maybe be happy someday I feel so sick and tired of everything which makes me lazy which makes me depressed because I m being lazy which makes more lazy It s an endless cycle of depression and abuse What s the point Right now it feels like nothing can get rid of the emptiness that I feel inside I know the feeling will pass as it has before but those questions will always be there in the back of my head Why should I Why should I do anything What s the point I feel a little better after typing this though ,0
I don t know what s going on in my life everything is really confusing I know what I want to do but nothing I do to achieve it works I know that it is a matter of time dedication and perseverance besides that nothing comes overnight but it has been 7 years and I do not see a single result In all that time only bad things happen and I feel that it s no longer worth fighting for a dream that may not be for me ,0
i m so sick of everythingfriendship in ruins ocd flare up and now my stomach is in tatters fearful it s cancer mind can t get any restbite i am so sick of living like this,0
Offing myself isn t actually my first choice what I really would like to do is stay at home forever with my dog and my boyfriend and maybe work part time online or something But I can t do that so I d really rather just be dead Living just feels like such a chore There s nothing I really want to do with my life that anyone would pay me a livable wage for and every job I ve ever had makes me cry and want to kill myself even more I can t concentrate on any task that s actually important I don t even think I ll be able to finish college because even though I m on Vyvanse it only works for 2 hours I made a counseling appointment but I doubt it will help Does anyone get what I m talking about ,0
i feel like i m veering of the deep end again this is the 5th time this month ,0

Throwaway for obv reasons English isn t my first language on mobile etc I will kill myself I can t stand if anymore I have nobody to reach out to nobody that cares if I live or not I ve had one friend that I have talked to about my problems and feelings and she abandoned me I was too annoying and made her feel bad I totally get where she s coming from so I guess I will just do her and everyone else a favor and end it all I got nothing to loose at this point and nobody would really care anymore I was and am a total worthless piece of shit and nobody is scared of loosing me The only sense of happiness I feel is when I think about ending it all Posting here is my last resort or maybe I feel like I want to leave something behind,0
what does it mean when a friend says im in the mood for someone to text rn and talk whilst talking to u like am i not someone u re talkin to i feel like im only the available comfortable venting friend to keep them company when they have no one else but im not the friend they want im just there i get it wanting to talk to other people but while we re talkin just means im not that someone they want to talk to rn just the one that s available and i had this feeling multiple other times where they would express how bored they are while we re talkin and ignoring me when someone else messages oh and when i asked like is this not texting they said no this is different like im tired of not being the first choice or good enough i want to cut everyone off and never give my time to anyone like that again and never consider anyone a friend,0
Was able to muster up all the courage to ask out the nerdy guy ive always had a crush in got rejected I mean im pretty cute myself but seriously Sigh maybe I should also focus on my education the same way he is focusing on it ,0
I have gone and still going through the same situation as you I have been to several psychiatrists therapists and none could help me Yet here I m still trying to survive for one more day I m 23 with no degree or job or life purpose Although my family have the financial means to help me yet I m not happy and I tried to commit suicide two times already I tried several antidepressants with doses ranging from 10m to 60m but nothing worked I tried CBT too and to be honest I felt like I m being lied to so I can feel a little better CBT is definitely not all bad but definitely was not the magic pill for me I now exercise and take high dosage of fish oil I think it helped me a little but nothing crazy Although we might not be able so solve your problem but I am still writing this to give you a sense of community that you can belong to and to let you that we are all on the same boat and that you are not alone ,0

Goodbye allI am 65 years old My brother just took my half of the family farm that our parents left to us because he could afford good lawyers and I couldn t He is now suing me for well what he is suing me for I do not know because I don t have anything left What I do have is a motorcycle a passport and a few dollars in cash so I am going South I have never done Heroin but I know I will like it I saved it up for the end of my life I m going to Mexico I am going to find a beach with a good sunset and I m going to OD in a hammock there I can think of a lot of worse ways to go out Good luck all It s been real ,0
It just doesn t feel like I can make it through this timeI keep trying to tell myself that I have been through major depressive episodes before and have made it through to the other side It just doesn t feel like I m going to make it out of this one I feel so lucky to have some incredibly caring people in my life but I ve just become such a burden on them in my downward spiral My work is suffering and that makes me lose my confidence further I ve gotten so deep into this dark place and it truly feels like there is no way out I genuinely do want to avoid suicide but it no longer feels like an option I don t have money or transportation for therapy and Im at a point where I feel like it would be a waste of resources I know how much it would help my mother to receive my life insurance pay out If there is any way I can access some method of convincing myself that life would be worth living id truly be open to taking it But it s so far out of reach Why work so hard to continue to live in pain ,0
You suffer more when you continue to liveI hate how because I m not man enough to kill myself I have to continue to suffer ,0

Wanting a relationship but being out of shape working on that ugly and no personality or real talents as well as poor means i m shit out of luck 26 years old and i have never spent a night with a woman Obviously more important things than sex but i m still a guy and want to experience it so not having any skill in that area sucks real fucking bad I just can t possibly see a good future I m not going back to school ever so I m stuck with a hs diploma and my current job is really good and pays well for what I can get but realistically i ll never own a house i ll always be renting living paycheck to paycheck and it will always suck,0

Class consciousness is a gift and a curse When we all dawn this realization society can change but when only the few have it it s an unbearably truth to live with Honestly the only thing keeping me around is the mass awakening to these concepts we are having as a society But if I were to pursue a career as like a political pundit and talk about these things it s not like anyone would listen,0
I recently lost a friend I had been friends with for 5 years but it was a toxic friendship and he hit the nail on the head when he started texting sexual shit to my sister and I cut it off there I recently found his twitch browsing it and checked it out I was using a different account so he didn t know it was me and he was looking for a different group of friends cuz of the one who dropped him me and my friends cuz I told them about what happened and I asked him if it was his fault he was forced out of his group and he said no Typically don t like violence but this situation made me so angry about what a shitty friend he was and what he sent to my older sister made me want to slam his head into a wall I just feel like venting his odd if anyone even sees this I m just happy I got it out of my system,0

Why the fuck am i depressed and hate myself I have great life generally i m in med school i have supportive awesome family and friends i m so smart i m good looking but for no reason i have been depressed and hate myself for 5 years and now i m thinking of suicide ,0

DAE find that having suicide as an option to be almost liberating I find it somewhat relaxing and reassuring to know that if I can t cope with life anymore suicide is always an option to set myself free Thinking about this makes me very sad but at the same time calms me down from any stress and anxiety I m serious when I ask whether thoughts like this normal I guess this stems from my desire to always be free from society By that I mean I ve always hated the idea of having to be be tied down to starting a family or taking out a mortgage I love an independent and minimalist lifestyle and suicide seems to fit perfectly into this as I can be totally free from life edit I wasn t sure whether to post this here or to depression edit 2 great I m being downvoted of course no one gives a shit,0
Yep especially the ones about selling me pseudoscience cures Dont forget to always report them to the moderators who knows maybe they ll give you a cookie right SQLwitch ,0
This is possibly NSFW for discussion of self harm I feel permanently empty Even when I m happy it s still there I have a loving family that s more important to me than anything but sometimes I feel so disconnected that I find myself not even caring about them anymore There s no reason for me to feel this way I have healthy relationships with my family and friends and I take meds for depression and anxiety so it must be my fault somehow Cutting is the only thing that helps but I got sent to a mental hospital from an overdose a few weeks ago so my parents have locked up everything sharp I m trying so hard not to hurt myself but I can t see a point to living like this Can someone please help me understand this and how to make it go away ,0

Do normal people think about suicide daily For as long as I remember I have had the daily thought just kill yourself but I ALWAYS have 100 s of reasons not to The simplest part of my daily life is dismissing these thoughts I really don t consider my self at risk or suicidal I was just wondering if this was a normal thing I m getting really annoyed and aggravated that I keep having these thoughts Has anyone been in a similar situation ,0
I m so lonelyI feel like I don t connect with anyone like I m just a casual aquantence and co worker never a friend My therapist told me that s normal and that adult life is often lonely I ve never been touched romantically by someone not even a hug I m not terrible looking but my anxiety has stopped me from doing anything involving dating I want someone to look at me and think of me as theirs to love me My therapist also told me I m hyper empathetic I just want someone to care for me the same way I do for casual people at the very least But I want to be loved for once genuinely loved to be someone s person It seems so attainable to others but so far away for me If I could end it and stop my mind from running in circles I d do it But I don t have the balls,0

The grass is always greener I thought I d be happier when I got my license Not really I thought I d be happier when I turned 18 Nope I thought even being at community college would make me happier than I was in high school Nope And now I m finally realizing that the same is going to happen at normal college too I m going to get there and my life will be just as shitty Every day will be spent inside with little to no human contact outside of the Internet I won t make friends I won t find a girlfriend who d stay with a loser anyway and I m never gonna bring myself to die I ll never be able to get myself to do anything about my problems I m stuck in this rut hating life and myself waiting for nothing as my mind slowly tears itself apart and whenever any changes come along it will never be enough All I can do is wait until I get a lucky break or until I snap and kill myself and this waiting is just worse than the depression itself I m so lost ,0
Not entirely the way I phrased this but hear me out For the past few months I ve been going out and getting completely smashed having a good time doing funky drugs and not worrying if I get sick injured arrested or even die His mental health ridden past had taught him through his own experience that these behaviors are usually acted out by people with suicidal thoughts and more often the same people who would actually do it Those like lil peep Cobain and a bunch of other characters have a similar experience with these things If this is you you should probably seek some psychiatric help,0

 These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift Let alone the 3 hour calls that don t end well eh It s extremely rare for crisis line responders to do 12 hours shifts for many reasons including compassion fatigue Ours are 4 hours for phone shifts and 5 for online chat Double shifts are strongly discouraged ,0

I hit my mum today for the first time in a long time She didn t deserve it she never has ever deserved it I hate myself for the way I ve treated her and I wish I could go back and fix everything I ve destroyed People say things to me or provoke me when I m already feeling low and it causes me to fly off the handle and I emerge into someone that I despise After these episodes I often think about ending my life I don t think I have the guts to Unless one day I badly hurt someone out of anger because the guilt would consume me Sometimes I cut myself after these episodes because it seems fair but there s only so much that can do My mum is a lovely caring woman and everyone in her life treats her like shit including me and I m stuck in this cycle that I don t know how to change I need help,0

The class system The people at the top Live comfortably Enjoying all the luxury that life has to offer Never worrying about budgeting money Due to Financial issues being non existent Living a dream most people will never know The people in the middle Work their fingers to the bone Always playing the lottery Yet never winning Trapped in an endless cycle of Bill s and mediocrity The people at the bottom Are forgotten by society Left to rot on a cold street while the unrelenting rain pours Their eyes convey only sadness Their stomachs are empty as their pockets and will to live People look at them like they are a diseased Hope fades away day by day Until nothing remains except the urge to end this living nightmare they find themselves in ,0

Things stuck if you want to kill yourselfIt s like you can look for help but any kind of immediate help or advice centers around convincing you not to want what you currently want So either be convinced that you re wrong about what you want kill yourself big mistake or just live with the pain of wanting to kill yourself but not being able to It Is Awful,0

I d ask for help but i don t care anymoreI am not sure why i am even writing here Life might be good for some alas i am not one of them I have tried to end this sick joke a couple of times already in the past months but all those attempts were a spur of the moment kind of thing The fact that noone gives a shit isn t even enough to push me over the edge anymore which is very frustrating in and of itself I wish i had the willpower to consciously make the leap ,0
Ive been through too much shit to list but the most important thing is I have binge eating disorder had numerous inpatient stays seeing therapy 2x per week currently zero changes that has gained me 70 pounds which makes me want to kill myself and I feel zero pleasure from literally anything and haven t for years I used heroin for 20 days straight no longer using to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged This means no leaving my room interacting etc for a week at least and I have two very important family things im canceling in a few minutes ,0
Does anybody here wake up and instead of feeling super groggy and not wanting to get up you instead feel extreme stress extreme despair extreme nervous energy Like you HAVE to get up and do SOMETHING but you don t know what that something is You are hit with a wave of extreme low mood and extreme anxiousness at the same time To me this is the most maddening of a depressive state ,0

Living for others Why Obviously most of us on here are suicidal or have been at one point I m wondering what stops us all from actually going through with it Is it guilt about the people that will me left behind I tell myself that s why Is it fear of failing I looked on that bestgore website that someone posted about Yes it s gory and honestly it mocks almost everyone who committed suicide It shows the truth of some forms but not others Are we afraid of the pain If it is living because of the guilt left behind why are we so worried It won t be our problem Are we afraid we ll push others over the edge I m honestly done my body and more importantly my brain is just done with depression anxiety migraines body aches etc I don t want to deal with it anymore But I can t get past the thought of my mom finding me in bed Or the idea what no parent should have to bury their child I say when she s gone so am I but my grandmother is almost 94 not sure I can stay around that long So basically what s the point of waiting ,0
all i need is everything to stopI d like to die Please,0

You want someone to feel emotional pain Why I think that sounds wonderful if no one could cry at my funeral I would not want to bring emotional pain like that to someone especially if it s someone I care about I think that s the thing driving me from ever kicking the chair I hate to offend but I think that s selfish to wish for someone to feel emotional grief like that have you seen someone go through grief It s terrible It s ugly and painful and I wouldn t wish it on anyone So why would you want someone to go through that Sorry if I hurt someone by saying this I do not intend this to be offensive I m just astounded that people genuinely think this and I want to know why ,0

I don t have any emotional supportI can t talk to anyone close to me for several reasons and I know I should call like a crisis line or see a therapist but those things seem so clinical and like you re not really connecting with anyone on a emotional level but I feel so suffocated and isolated and can t think of a coping skill to save my life besides keep everything to myself and then when I m in private I just suffer I take sleeping pills and cut myself to try to find some comfort because no one will comfort me and I don t know how to comfort myself,0
I don t understand how to stop feeling like life is a chore It s boring and I feel so useless most of the time I m not passionate about anything and I used to rely on routine to at least try to keep my life in order but now it seems like every day is waking up and counting the hours so I can go back to sleep again I hate monotony I hate this pandemic and I hate myself so much I wish I could like something and work and just get an apartment somewhere far away from my family I wish I was dead I just want to stop feeling this way ,0
Started to write letters to be found if I m gone where do I go from here I always thought that there was stop much to live for but the monotony and the feeling of being out of control of my own life is just not enough any more Throwaway account for obvious reasons I wish I could talk to my gf of many years about it but I just can t broach the subject with her Knowing my nephew would grow up while my brother would have to explain where one of his uncles was used to be enough but now it s just not doing the job Everyone around me knows something s wrong I m stressed short with people quick to anger generally not a nice person to be around None of them know why I started to think of what I would say in letters today and it struck me as a turning point in my attitude to suicide I don t know what to do Can anybody help or give some insight ,0
Life is boringI have no friends or someone to talk about stuff life is so pointless,0
I ve struggled with anxiety and self hatred for so long and it has completely destroyed me I am a negative piece of shit and I want to move on I m unhealthy and gained a ton of weight the past few months I m committing to eating healthier and exercising more I want to commit myself to photography and art but never thought I was good enough My mum told me today that she believes in me and that I am talented She said I can achieve anything when I put my mind to it she has seen it before It gave me strength to believe in myself and that I have purpose and a place This is the beginning ,0
Who am I I wish there was a way for me to want to get better for myself But i don t think I want to Well i don t know but I regret telling anyone how I ve felt before because they assume that now they know and I ve gotten help means I ll magically recover But any help I ve gotten seems useless I don t know who I am without my depression though and that scares me I don t remember a time without it and it s hard to imagine one in the future I don t seem to go a day without suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming myself I just feel like I m this empty shell of a person and it d be easier if I just wasn t here anymore ,0
Sometimes it feels like everything isn t real Nothing I do matters and it seems like the world will never stop I look around and everything I see is awful People hating people abusing people torture war disease famine Like what is wrong with the world Why can t people just show others kindness and love Are some incapable And the world is dying But no body cares at least not enough people do in order to do anything about it Everything just sucks and trying to simply exist is too difficult ,0
I d choose to die There s absolutely nothing I want I have a lot but it s not what I need I just want my suffering to end Nothing can make me happy I just want to be at peace ,0
Vent post So i m 19 I m an introvert amp very shy Because of this I did pretty horrible in school Too shy to get a job Doing horrible in college I don t even have friends Only a boyfriend I feel like I am just taking up space in earth My parents are just wasting money on me I feel like my family would be better off without me I m a waste of money amp space I m useless I know I sound like a lazy spoiled brat but I promise that s not it I get so nervous around people my hands sweat amp I can t speak up I wish I could just be normal ,0

Life isn t neat it s a bunch of chaosWhen things go as planned I m just like Well that s the way it should be but when things don t go smoothly or as planned I get so overly disheartened I can t live like this for the rest of my life getting depressed and frustrated over failures that happened years ago How do I accept things the way they are I ve read so many ways to try to cope I don t know what to do I can t change my mindset Nothing in life is worth it due to this Suicidal thoughts are frequent ,0

I keep breaking downJust learned another kid I knew die recently Just saw him the other week Almost confessed my plans slip after finding out He said that s always a way I agreed Just not the way that most people see I broke down crying in the subway I wasn t even close to this kid but I could feel his pain I can t say that the idea of just falling in front of the next train didn t cross my mind But I can t traumatize someone else like that I feel my lifeline snap one by one Each day I m falling more and more downward spiral Why am I still here undeservingly alive 3 years ago I was saved But now I don t think it will happen again My strength fades more each day I just have to hold on a little while longer But that urge hits me more each day I was sitting on my bathroom floor against the wall crying myself silly I m breaking down daily I can t do this anymore I m slipping further into the darkness and honestly I don t want to get out this time ,0
Why bother with life I feel out of place i have next to no friends im to socially awkward to talk to people and i hate my self i wanna kill my self This life just isnt meant for me and i dont know if i should stay or go I think its time for me to say good bye,0
You know when you hear the same joke and it gets less funny every time That s how my life feels My appeal has completely worn off Every day it just gets more stale I ve tried different variations of myself all worse than the next The best one is getting old and is not that good to begin with Does anyone else feel this way Like their life is a show that s gone on for too many seasons ,0
I literally can t remember the last time I hung out with a friend I m racking my brain and I just can t remember so naturally it must be many years ago That s pretty sad I can t even remember the last conversation I had with a friend via text or otherwise It makes me feel like such a sad pathetic person Like no one wants anything to do with me I don t even know how I could be that terrible of a person ,0
might just kill myself tonight D edit i m sad cuz i m codependent on him and i can t live without him,0

The taboo of Suicide Something that I would like to see happen is the legalization of suicide Everyday is torture for me because of my depression I have been depressed for many years now and after all these years it doesn t get any easier to deal with I know that it is selfish to just abandon friends and family but is it not selfish of them to keep me here as well I ve tried counseling talking to friends and family meds and just about everything and nothing changes You can t even openly talk to most people about suicide it s something you have to carry with you and for those who do try to talk will mostly not understand what it is like for you There are plenty of us out there who have had depression for years who have thought about suicide everyday who have thought things through carefully and know that it is what we really want but due to pressure from friends family and our society we can t kill ourselves What are your thoughts on this ,0
My dreams are unattainableWhat s the point if I ll never be able to achieve what I want in life,0
I feel so numb but I can t say that to my friends because i m the therapist friend I am supposed to be just fine I feel like relapsing I can never please the people in my family I never feel like smiling but I do anyways I ve never been one to wish but I wish I could be genuinely happy and I wish I didn t feel numb I wish I wasn t abandoned by everyone I love I wish my dad hadn t left maybe then I wouldn t feel this way and wouldn t blame myself for everything Thanks for reading my little rant cry for help ,0
Just give me a good reason not to do it I m just tired Tired of my life of people that doesn t care a little bit about me of my disgraceful job of everything I want a way out I still didn t do it because I m afraid to fail And also because I m afraid I ll end up killing my father he s old frail not the best health But each passing day is more difficult I can t stand this life anymore This emptiness This sensation of never doing anything meaningful the certainty that I ll just die alone and forgotten because of my horrible personality Please just say something Or I swear I ll do it Sooner or later ,0

Does anyone else feel like you re never going to be happy I ve been depressed most of my life over the last year and half I ve been on an antidepressant It s helped my anxiety but I m not necessarily happy just numb Is this as good as it gets I was talking to my doctor earlier trying to explain to him that I don t feel good and I haven t for a long time and maybe we should switch antidepressants because I don t think this one is helping and causing weight gain fatigue exhaustion etc and he was just like nope you re fine and completely ignored my concerns Does it ever get better or am I just destined to be miserable for the rest of my life,0
I am lost adrift with no hope of rescue and no hope that the future is going to be less terrible The only reason I haven t put my shotgun barrel into my mouth is because I have a wife and kids who are depending on me Antidepressant medication is just barely doing anything and I haven t had luck with therapy I m out of options but to continue on this dead end path to nowhere The world is headed down a spiral to mass death and doom and nobody cares to stop it Everything is hopeless and it doesn t matter I deserve to suffer because I am a member of this accursed species ,0

A year or two ago I gave up on love and ever really finding a sense of belonging with family friends or whatever and I told myself as long as I have my passion for music martial arts I could keep going Unfortunately it feels like it has become less and less enjoyable for me Recently despite making it on the fight team at my local mma gym I feel like shit Making music used to be everything for me but I can hardly get the motivation to open up FL Studio anymore Nothing is fun anymore Sleepless nights unemployed alone and now my last lines of defense against the mental void is slipping What can I do Am I just going to be a walking corpse for the rest of my life ,0

I ve been doing controlled hanging for a few months nowWhen I was 16 I promised myself I would hang myself on my 20th if nothing gets better I turned 17 yesterday Although I won t kill myself right now I ve been practicing hanging I guess you could say When everyone s out of the house I ll tie myself up to the staircase railing and see how far I can go The first time I did it I was just gagging before I stopped The second time I did it I was coughing gagging and gasping for breath rapidly The 3rd time which was just now my vision got blurry all my rapid breathing became raspy my stomache was hurting I had a weird sound in my ears where I couldn t hear much else through it and I could hear my heartbeat really loudly When you do it for real is it worse than this Or is this the extent of what it feels like After experiencing an overdose hanging myself only is a slight discomfort and panic compared to the agony if an overdose ,0

You get to a point where the anxiety and depression will stop you in your tracks and possibly debilitate you for a while Then there s another point where you re just so used to it that you can t help but push on Because letting these thoughts ground you will return you to those unbearable slumps I m trying to survive these hits these brain attacks But man it s so fucking hard Any ambition or goal that I finally start believing in and working towards it can go away in a flash And just like that you re back to having zero motivation and no purpose We need to fight through that I need to believe we can keep fighting ,0

My brother was diagnosed with MDD w to psychotic features over a month ago Despite having anti psychotic meds and a therapist he only seems to be getting worse It s only me my mom and him The pressure is literally crushing my mom He refuses to be open with anyone other than his girlfriend who has her own shit to deal with He gets angry when my mom tries to check on him when he s spiraling almost to the point where I m scared to talk to him We wake up to him banging on his walls so loud that my room shakes We ask him what s going on and he either ignores us or says he s fine His therapists won t talk to us without his permission which is understandable We can t afford for him to see a psychiatrist regularly and not many take his insurance I feel like all we can do is watch him get worse and idk what to do ,0

i have schizophrenia and i feel very isolated i have been reading the stories in this reddit thing and it makes me sad but also relieves me that there are plenty others who feel that their time is near this may sound a bit morbid but maybe sometimes we dont need to live maybe we dont have a choice if we are born but we should have a choice to end it if we so desire trouble is that if the attempt does not work you are at risk of being institutionalized and the truth is those facilities or at least the ones ive been in are far from therapeutic i wish i could be a normal person with a normal brain who does not think of dying and the ways in which to do so almost if not all day is there anyone who feels the same i find myself to be cowardly nowadays when it comes down to doing what i need to do i think that is because i have attempted and failed so many times anyway i hope this message reaches somebody out there thanks ,0

I don t know exactly why I am the way that I am at first I would say that I am not depressed I don t match all the symptoms That was an excuse obviously then it got worse It is a mix of shitty days and just being in the same room as my parents I try hard to tell myself it s not my parents fault you are this way but yes they are a big reason and coming to that realization really is disappointing I don t know whether to keep asking my parents for help or just wait until im old enough but I have been thinking Should I tell my friends I dont want to force anything on them or trauma dump on them I just want to be acknowledged I just want someone else to tell me you are not okay and need help besides me I will talk to the wall for an hour telling myself all the reasons why I want someone to know besides me They don t even need to help I just want the knowledge that someone else knows So do you think I should tell them Sorry if the formatting is weird I m on mobile You can ask for details as well ,0

Wherever i go whomever i talk to i see a disgusting hypocrisy Especially in women Like you hate racism but you bash short and ugly men You have empathy and help the weak but you bash virgins Women don t have morals They really don t They only help and support what s cool to help and support They lack the emotion of compassion Their morals don t come from the emotion of compassion like men Their moral is just built by social dynamics I hate you women ,0
Serious Suicidal Thoughts Make Me Feel Like I don t hate life I guessToday I woke up thinking that tomorrow I m going to buy a gun and kill myself I looked up the closest place to get a gun and went to work fully convinced that tomorrow I m going to buy a gun This initially put me in a fairly good mood Then during my lunch break at work when I was doing some suicide related searches I started feeling sad and got some tears so I figured that I m not ready amp I must like life enough to feel kind of sad at the prospect of dying ,0

I ve posted to this Subreddit before and I really didn t want to post again but here we are I m having progressively more suicidal thoughts ever so recently because of an incident I don t want to reveal too much but I think I ruined a relationship with someone who I see as a mother figure and a friend of mine is making a big deal out of the situation in my opinion Another friend has also been affected by this and they mean alot to me I don t know how to handle this situation right now especially with my friend who s hurting alot I just really feel like disappearing to everyone right now no sign of me anywhere I m just really tired and was wondering if I could have some advice ,0
Cheer me upI just dont want life anymore everyone is better ,0
the feeling of being impure and dirty never leaves it s been more than 8 years and i never forget it it s like there s always a darkness covering my body that follows me everywhere i still feel his fingers on me and his voice in my ear i just want it to end so bad ,0
To begin i apologize for my english i m not a native english speaker also i can t see a lot through my tears I ll be 20 in about 2 weeks and as long as i can remember i always felt empty sad or angry Mostly because i grew up in a toxic family i can t part with because i m kinda dependant to them So i tried seeking help last year un february then Covid happened And i had my first meeting with a psychologist from my college She helped me a lot i even thought that i ll finally be free That i won t feel like that anymore Guess i was lying to myself again I just feel like if was done like i couldn t fight with sadness anymore as if it won I don t know if i ll be able to stay i don t wanna live anymore and it s been months i don t even feel alive anymore Just emptiness i m tired i don t know what i should do,0
I know what you mean I cant listen to the chirps I listen to the waves crashing because there are no other sounds I use Medito app Totally free and lots of content ,0
I am at the end of my rope and can t stop crying I asked for help and was pushed away because he thinks I m faking it Or he doesn t want to be bothered with me I m going to my doctor tomorrow That s the earliest I can get an appointment I m sure she will just prescribe antidepressants I ve been on every brand of antidepressants and they don t work I think I just need someone to talk to who can be a friend and not my therapist Someone who will care Someone who will sit with me and hold my hand in the darkness But when I yell out for help there is only an echo I almost ended it all on Sunday I don t know why I stopped I should have just finished the Job right there and then ,0
I m readyI thought I was holding off on killing myself because I wanted to get everything set for the people I love But I just don t care anymore I know they ll figure it all out It ll be hard but they re strong I just can t do this anymore I m ready to end it all All the pain and suffering The nightmares the panic attacks the constant internal agony I m numb and I m ready Thank you to everyone for your kind words in the past I hope that you all find happiness and joy ,0
Hey man whats gone is gone What you can do is live a fkin awesome rest of ur life Go to beach fk Breath Just enjoy Life is too short to think about past and weep You got it buddy ,0
Realizing you are depressed takes a lot of time and affects you badly the more you delay not accepting it or hating yourself for being Depressed Now coming to the title The time flies by and before you realize you have passed a lot of months with nothing happening but just the constant worry and suffering It s extremely hard to get a grasp on time and look out for short term goals or positivity Anyone feels the same ,0
 I have been feeling like this for weeks and with my social life crumbling my supports have slowly disappeared Every day i wake up only to want to go back to sleep only sleep is keeping me away from my thoughts Lately i have been experiencing alot of looming thoughts of just disappearing and somehow stop this pain i have tried almost everything from self love to self care and nothing seems to be working ,0
I can t tell anyone what I m feeling anymore I think I might end it all and it s scary,0

I am constantly having intrusive thoughts about killing my self It has gotten so bad were i can feel a rope closing down on my throat But i am not self harming or putting a rope to my throat Does anyone know good copping mechanisms or breathing exercises that can help subside these thoughts ,0
I m really bad about neglecting myself I go days without brushing my hair or teeth I basically shower twice a week and only because I have to work I have split days off so I work 3 days off 1 work 2 off 1 and I ll shower before I go to bed after my day off Bad about trimming my toenails washing my face etc Thankfully my anxiety and fear about my job letting me go for being unkempt keeps it from getting worse I feel like taking better care of myself would help my depression a bit but I don t even remember most of the things and other things just feel like too much work like preparing for a shower Is there anything you d suggest to help me actually get these things done ,0
with an open bar,0
Whenever I feel anger sadness frustration or any other negative emotion there was a number of ways for me to escape Such as going on a walk biking hanging out with friends and such A personal favorite is just listening to music However it seems like recently nothing is helping As if I have used it so much that I grew tolerance Like drinking so much coffee that you don t feel energized I have been feel more stress dread and frustration that I cannot even listen to a very good song without thinking about my mistakes and how shitty I am I can t stop thinking about how much I hate being myself These escapes were my way of feeling better and I couldn t and still can t seem to talk to anyone because it feels that it would not help I would just feel even more shitty by making them feel worried I just want to be able to listen to music and relax ,0
I don t know if I should continue going to school I m only going for a degree so that I could get a good job but I have no idea what that would even be because even the best job still sounds like a waste of a life to me In the meantime school is still making me feel suicidal and that makes me think I should stop but at the same time I do think that I need a certain amount of money to be happy because living in the U S is way more difficult and expensive than it should be ,0
Ooof That s tough I ve been there too Are you in the states Psychology today keeps a database on their website of therapists and whether they re accepting new patients Whether you can get an appointment in the next 3 mons is another story but it s a place to start,0
I think I m done I m always angry I grew up living with an abusive father and right now things are constantly worst I told my family that I am not feeling okay has thoughts of wanting to die a year ago and didn t get any support I m still a student so I have no money on my own to seek professional help Still locked up in the house due to pandemic bad government in my country Everyday is hell My anger sometimes is poured to my pets I hurt them and I think soon enough I will hurt people or maybe kill them So yeah instead of doing another bad action which harms my pets or do something extreme that other people may be included I will just kill me I want to be at peace already,0
Hey sooooo im about to do it so im here to say thanks to everybody that helped me I love u guys thanks for beeing there for me Goodbye,0
I dont amount to anything I struggle to find meaning for my existence I want to do something but i am to weak I feel hopeless I am just leeching off life and not doing anything It is like i was born to suffer People always expect me to be happy for what i have but what is it worth if i dont make myself do anything with it I feel like everyone is better than me and i hate it I also hate that i might deserve this suffering Some people just except that life is like that and they were born that way but it angers me why me I feel like skeletal remains of my past potential and i will continue to regret and never stop ,0
Lost everythingLost story short Another person said I done something I didn t Police took it to far I lost all my licences I lost my buisness then lost my other job Got dragged through the courts and then they offered me to go free if I never done anything again which I never anything in the first place Now I have nothing I can t do any of my enjoyable hobbies or anything because they took my right to do anything I cant go out with my friends because they mite get in trouble Ive lost the will to live I can barely get out of bed every day the pain I feel every day feels like my heart is being ripped out My partner is dealing with her own depression and PTSD We have a young daughter Ive talked to people before but nobody has ever helped me I hate taking anti depressants as they messed me up when I was younger I just feel like ending it I honestly can t deal with any more ,0
I got what I wantI told my best friend that I wanted him to hate me so much that he never wants to talk to me again I told him because he s the only thing keeping me here and I don t want to be here I want to go so bad He told me I d never get that so I need to stop trying to get it But I got it He hates me It s over Does anyone know if I can die by inhaling too much helium from helium balloons ,0
Just looking for a friend Hi you guys I m just really struggling right now and if anyone out there is feeling the same way I think it s help to chat for a bit It would make me feel a lot less worthless right now Thanks so much ,0

Does anyone else feel like you re never going to be happy I ve been depressed most of my life over the last year and half I ve been on an antidepressant It s helped my anxiety but I m not necessarily happy just numb Is this as good as it gets I was talking to my doctor earlier trying to explain to him that I don t feel good and I haven t for a long time and maybe we should switch antidepressants because I don t think this one is helping and causing weight gain fatigue exhaustion etc and he was just like nope you re fine and completely ignored my concerns Does it ever get better or am I just destined to be miserable for the rest of my life,0

Damn reading all these comments makes me think how happy this would actually make me but shortly I get sad again knowing this will never actually happen at least we have the subreddit,0
This makes a lot of sense and I wish I would ve read this years ago,0

Fucked Up and HopelessI feel that I ve truly fucked myself I have lost all the hope I had really I left public school to do online school because of my depression and anxiety And now that I m here as a senior getting ready to hear from colleges I feel I fucked up I wasted my years and did nothing The only thing I had to look forward to in life was perhaps getting away from where I live and going to college And now I feel like I won t even get in anywhere I applied to I have good grades above average test scores But I still feel like I ve fucked myself And in turn fucked my life I seriously feel hopeless and lost I have been in a depression rut for the past month and it seems to be only getting worse And now I m stuck in this state for another 2 months just waiting Waiting to know if I fucked myself or not Waiting to know if I should give up hope and end it or not It s killing me Or it will kill me,0
I m going to kill myself if I get kicked from my drama clubI failed some classes so now I m ineligible for my drama class This is the one thing I enjoy in my life I don t watch movies I don t play games I don t watch TV PTSD and depression from being molested has taken all those hobbies from me All I have left is drama I cried out of happiness when I found out I got a role in our musical Currently I m trying to see if the school will let me stay on aslong as I keep up my grades But if I m refused I m fucking done ,0

No idea where my life is going Feeling depressed everyday Medication is not working and is causing me constipation and making me more irritable Life seems to be upside down Everything annoys me and irritates me But yet at the worst point right now i feel relaxed I think sometimes when we are given too much control of our lives when life is perfect we feel less happy waiting for the next best thing That s for me at least My life is objectively quite shit right now yet i feel as a result of a loss of control of my life safe i feel i can make the best out of every day despite feeling like crap Edit I would like to give some examples Like i feel more grateful for alone time now instead of seeing it as being alone I feel happier now when i can get to eat food without pain i feel grateful for being able to go to the toilet and shit with ease I feel grateful for just being able to fall asleep It s depression that made me realise many things don t come natural to us,0
Take your meds exercise stay busy This is the only consistent advice I receive I m not really looking for advice I just want to die I thought life was going decently for a little bit I still wanted to die but at least I was being social and having some modicum of fun But recovery is a lot of hard work more than I can bear right now So I ll go back to wallowing in self pity and isolate myself from anyone who could show me fake love I know they don t really care They just don t want my death to inconvenience them Hope some people can relate to wanting to shut themselves off from the world I feel like I ve always been crazy for this ,0
It would have better to never been born at all that is my opinion,0
I still think suicide is the best answer towards lifeHow can i stop this way of thinking ,0
What can I say I m happy you messaged me but I do still miss you and have crazy dreams about you,0
Exist for yourself,0
I was told again how worthless I am They got me closer to suicide so I thanked them I want to die and being reminded how worthless I am definitely makes me more likely to commit suicide ,0
2018 is the year I beat depressionThis year s been rough for all of us and just because this one s been shit 2019 might not Good luck to everyone here I hope you find meaning and can start a new chapter ,0

Attacking someone s belief system even in directly when they re in crisis is emotional abuse ,0
the feeling that you are so helpless rightnow when all your loved ones got covid and you cant do anything because you lost your job ,0
I hate that I can t talk about my problems to my friends or family Most of them say they want to help but when things start to get too real for them they no longer want to listen Once you mention suicide they no longer want to be there The worst part is that when if I actually did go through with it they would be the first people to say if only he reached out for help I just want someone to try to understand what I feel and where I come from I just want my family to understand or at least attempt to understand Does anyone else feel this way Are your families comfortable with listening to you ,0
I feel completely hopeless I m terrified of the repercussions of suicide the effect it would have on my mom and boyfriend and those who love me the pain the possibility of a failed attempt and the big what happens after death question but I feel utterly hopeless right now I attempted suicide 8 years ago and was almost successful Sometimes the notion that I can end it if things get really bad relieves me And other times I fear for my own safety Today I m not sure where I am between the two I ve been agnostic for almost 22 years of life and I found myself crying and praying to God tonight I feel so low,0
I wish life had a restart button so many things I wish I could change ,0
I don t want to die but I don t want to exist There are people around me but I ve never felt more lonely I have a path I need to take but no one to guide me I m lost I m numb I m incomplete unfulfilled and unwanted So what s the point To live and make others happy Or to die and make them upset Either way they ll make it about themselves and judge my actions So really there is no difference no matter which direction I go ,0
My friends can t deal with my depression any moreI was told I need to get my shit together or they can t be my friends any more because I m just too much I haven t told them about my suicide attempt last week yet And if I do they will probably leave ,0
I ve been having suicidal thoughts everyday so strong that it feels like if I just flinched or moved the wrong way I would suddenly lose control of my body and give in I know I m safe I won t hurt myself But I want to so badly I m just so deeply sad and I don t know who to tell or how to say it I m stuck between being afraid of myself and not wanting to burden anyone else or make them worry for me It just feels like I m never going to feel different or be able to fix myself Anyway I don t know really why I m even saying any of this I guess I don t really want to tell the people in my life but I really need someone to talk to I m just so sad Anyway I hope you are all doing well and have a beautiful day Take care ,0
Im taking 4 pills a day and I still am sad its like I dont even want to be happy I dont want to be happy I want peace I dont belong here ,0
This might be my suicide noteI don t know if this will be my suicide note I hope not I hurt her I left her alone amp I seem to continue to do so I can t take this I can t take the shame I can t take the fear I can t take hurting my most loved one I want to die I m next to a window on a roof I jump I die But if I do that I will traumatize everyone in this house I am a shitty boyfriend I m probably a shitty friend My family hates me I have a lot of people who hate me I have hated me A ton I always want to destroy myself out of self hatred She feels forgotten Uncared for I wanna end it all She doesn t deserve my hurt I hurt her amp I feel like a monster I want to die amp I know how to do it I get ahold of some Perco s I DIE a peaceful euphoric death I just turned 16 Tomorrow is my birthday party And I hope I make it ,0

Whenever I think about making new friends I get like an existential crisis It s like I only want to be friends with my older friends and if I can t I don t want anymore friends I keep trying to get in contact with them and hope everything works out ,0
help i think my friends are toxic they dump everything on me but when i need someone to talk to they say they are busy or don t respond it really hit me when my friend was mad at me and i was crying and i heard her go to everyone asking and say something like she s just doing it for attention she s a horrible fucking person and stuff like that it was at school so who knows who s making rumors about me now she says she didn t do it but i heard her it hit my mental health like a fucking freight train i have hardly talked to anyone since the whole online school thing which is a whole other topic but whatever i feel like no one cares i want to die this is only one of the things that make me in this depressed sort of state i m scared that people will just tell me oh you re just a teenager you don t know anything about mental health hahahah but i do know and i know i want to find a way to kill myself ,0
I swear to god if one more person tells me to volunteer after opening up about my suicidal thoughts I m going to shoot myself and hope they get splatteredI get it I put on a good f cking facade people probably think I m just being full of myself I don t open up to people but the few times I have suicide hotline ER I get this advice I get it for someone who is just down in the dumps volunteering is awesome but for someone who constantly gives their all to other people it s bullsh t Its like their last attempt at helping once they ve gone through the list of things I ve already fucking tried Guess what I have volunteered and I hated it it felt forced and I already have a hard time doing anything for myself so spending what little I have on more people makes me incredibly depressed ,0
Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you re out of advice for the one who needs help and then what just leave the chat that would even make it worse for both of you In Public chat there s a good chance others may jump in where you got lost,0

Like why are people looking forward to a life full of suffering I am 17 and im not ready to be an adult I dont want to work 5 days a week and be a slave Even if I do well in school and get a great job money wont make me happy There is no love nothing lasts forever Life does not get better you just get used to it Until you cant anymore and you kill yourself Life is hell I cant see it as something else Death is my escape ,0
Well I guess it s about perspective ultimately Like I don t necessarily agree that romantic or interpersonal relationships are meaningless Some people might think they are the things that matter However your point isn t wrong per se either You do make sense when you say materials can bring us happiness albeit for a short while No one s really wrong in both perspectives I do agree though that life and world as a whole is meaningless ,0
A note in progress Does anyone have a suicide note that s a work in progress I got into a really dark place and started a note I abandoned it but sometimes return to it and add thoughts and explanations to it Is that normal Why do I do that The one thing that s keeping me back is my children I write them notes and add to existing ones constantly like I m gone Is that an ok way to deal with my thoughts I hate the idea of getting a pill from the Dr and I already know what a counselor is gonna say so I don t think they d help What are your thoughts Wtf is the internet ,0
I m closer than ever to doing it I keep imagining how my parents will feel and how my sister will feel I keep reflecting on my life I keep thinking about how tragic my death would be I keep trying to talk myself down every day and imagine a better future but none of it feels realistic and everything just seems to be getting worse for everyone collectively and I have no desire to move forward I don t see a good future with me in it I feel like I want to die every day I m at 30 seconds to midnight but I can t do it ,0

I don t get help I don t get love Nobody cares about what I m doing or how I m doing They tell me that I m not entitled to their attention but they seem to be paying attention to everyone except for me I get no love I get no attention This post will get no attention either Because I m not entitled to anyone s love or attention but everyone else is I get nothing but rudeness and criticism Nobody cares I m not entitled to their attention So I walk away and stay in a private place All of a sudden everyone wonders where I have been Why do they care I wasn t entitled to their attention So leave me alone I m sick of being nice because nobody cares I ll rather just die because nobody appreciates me,0

I have had a great support group through my depression However when I shoot a message and no one responds or if I try to call them and it goes to voicemail after 1 or 2 rings I instantly think I m being a burden to people I try to rationalize that people are busy or want to give me a thoughtful answer but when it turns to hours I start ruminating that people hate me I know it s toxic and it s my mind playing with me however getting stuck in that loop hurts a lot I ll start thinking oh my friend was responsive last week and picked up the phone why is this week different I ve been trying to tell my friends now that I m okay because I no longer want to be a burden I hate depression ,0
I m 21m and I would think it s depression or anxiety and I feel stupid cause I m not the brightest guy around it feels as though I m judged I d self medicate wit alcohol or weed which would give more anxiety but my doctor gave me lexapro I don t think it works idk it doesn t help cause I m alone and it doesn t matter if I m having a good time it only matters when it ends cause I have nothing that s interesting which is being alone and thinking about dying is scary and unavoidable so being alive is scary but I want to be better so what if I don t have the option too be better Edit I was already thinking I d get no replies but I got dm from someone trying too promote me drugs for my problems so that s all I get ok smh ,0

It s not fair that the world has just discarded me like this It s not fair that I got the parents I got Its not fair that I can t enjoy life yet everyone around me can Why ,0
I have been struggling for over 1 year now and nothing has improved If anything things have gotten worse Something has just clicked inside of me today I don t think my current situation will ever improve I can t stand being around my family who do not understand or support me It doesn t matter how many times I try to explain they will never understand and they will never help me I hate myself and I don t think that will ever change I have no support system and I know I never will ,0
I hate my life I feel no good emotions just pain pain and more pain My life is just endless suffering every single day It s not fair,0
I cannot function like this Constantly sad and worried with a dark cloud over my head When will this end I am only alive for my little sister CANNOT TAKE THIS ANY MORE ,0
I ll join the land ,0
I m doneWhy do I bother getting the help Why do I trust people to then turn on me What else will go wrong tonight think tonight s official think I m finally gonna do it I m not wanted all that everybody cares about is hacking my fucking accounts all they care about is hurting me more well I m done I can t do it anymore I don t deserve to be happy obviously and I definitely don t belong here maybe me finally committing suicide will finally show everyone I didn t do this shit,0
I ve been doing so well since maybe march feeling good in mental state and progressing in my job and been off my meds for month s and seeing my ex and talking to her have just set me back fucking progress indeed ,0
 removed ,0
It went horribly I failed really badly My neck hurts ,0
I am in so much pain right now it s almost completely unbearableI m in such intense emotional distress and being dead feels like a comforting option to end my suffering I know it may be an overreaction but being alive and pretending things are okay when they re not for so long feels like torture It just hurts so much I m very empathetic and I overthink about others and it burns my soul to watch people suffer and not be able to help because I can barely help myself anymore My stomach is constantly in knots my heart is racing and I can t even think straight It s just too hard to clear my mind of the injustice I see around me good people being hurt punished while cruel people are rewarded Why is some of humanity so relentless and quick to sacrifice others I don t want to be around it anymore I have no one to tell this to so I m venting on the internet Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did ,0
Bye,0
Leaving this threadI was in the inpatient program for 3 weeks and I want to thank you all for supporting me when I needed it I ve made a great recovery and it may be still going but I think that this thread is not where I need to be anymore Best wishes to you all ,0
Ok So i was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago after my marriage broke down I went to therapy It helped I took metazapine It helped I exercise daily It helped I lost weight with Keto and intermittent fasting It helped When things started getting bad I went back to therapy It helped I m now seeing a new lady in my life She checks all the boxes and we both love each other But whenever the smallest thing happens that upsets me I just tell her I wanna take a break from the relationship It s happened 3 times now I know I m being unreasonable I just straight away go to that dark place for a few hours She s very understanding so that does help a lot What more can I do I m on the max dosage for my medication I don t want my depression to spoil what could be a great long term relationship ,0
Dear future wife Will you miss me ,0
I ve fucking had it with being treated the way I amEvery fucking person abandons me I m so fucking alone Give me one reason why I should keep living this shit life in this shit world,0
I have left everyone and isolated myself in my room I can t feel satisfied or even excited about anything I simply don t care anymore I don t want to get help because I don t think it ll work I feel miserable and hopeless ,0
I feel like I m on the edgeI just want to get the courage to kill myself and end this suffering once and for all I m 22 I ve been diagnosed with depression about 7 years ago and taking meds since then There was some moments where I kind of felt better but lately everything seems to be going downhill ,0
I m going to kill myself at the end of the year if my life doesn t get better ill try but I m so sick of this shit everyday,0
I never struggled with this before when I was depressed but now it seems like there is no point in getting up and out of bed I don t have anything to do but when I don t do anything it makes me feel worthless and like my family doesn t want me around I ve scoured the internet for help but it never addresses the root of the issue and is like just get up Any advice ,0
I feel like I m just postponing deathI don t really know how to explain it I feel like I should have died long ago I ve planned to so many times but I always come up with some sort of dumb excuse not to Right now that excuse is a concert I m going to with my friend in February I don t know what I m going to do after that and it scares me I know people care about me I know it could be worse I know I could probably have a good life but I m so fucking tired of crying myself to sleep and constantly fighting the urge to hurt myself I wish I could just get hit by a car in a tragic traffic accident so it would just be over ,0
Its sad being in the now I have to wait for things to workout in my life before I can meet that special someone It s gonna be a long time before I m ready to be someones significant other A lot of expectations I gotta meet It will take some years then I ll be ready I wish I was never born Living is too much pressure Life is not worth the problems you gotta go through the feelings you have to feel Feeling unwanted depressed angry upset guilt Its just not worth it This is my life But life is a game And I don t know what I m doing It should not be this hard to just be born live and die Everything in between is what sucks I really hope my life is worth not killing myself cause if I m 25 and still feeling this way then thats it Its not getting any better I know I m not owed anything I m not a gift I don t think being in a relationship should project that Everyone deserves to be happy in love Why is it so taboo to want to be in love in a relationship I m know what I m not ,0
my parents constantly tell me that i m doing nothing living and doing nothing is a battle in itself for me ,0
Some things were said to me and it made me rethink if I should live anymore at all Rethink if I m even a decent person rethink if I m capable of loving or being loved rethink if I m capable of caring for a person Because the one person I loved and cared for so much said that there s nothing more fake than my love and that I never cared for her and never did It broke my heart and I don t know if I should even get married to anyone or talk to anyone or even live anymore I hate myself so much,0
I really really need someone to talk to right now specially a woman I have no one to talk to about a very traumatic and awful thing that happened I can t tell my family about and I need someone objective to give me advice I suffer from severe anxiety and chronic depression I don t have very good coping strategies and just need some advice please ,0

You ever just get out of a super anxiety inducing situation and just have a depressive episode and your too afraid of opening up and talking about it to anyone because you don t wanna seem like a needy freak Well I do Or you want to vent to someone but don t want to scare them away ,0
I love the fact that I get hated for everything that i do I cant do anything without someone judging me or giving me a dirty look and it s not how I dress everyone just hates me I think its because I m not a horrible person and I have human decency that s probably why I find it hard to be happy when no one enjoys your presence ,0
Damn I can t sleepThis has been so hard and idk y I ve been in this agony for so long And the weird thing is I have so many reasons to feel bad I just can t be happy Life isn t something that I want Ps I hate saying so much negative things personally But it s just all truth ,0
I don t want to liveThere is literally not a single person I love or even moderately like in this world anymore and I ve tried thinking hard about this for a long time but no one comes to my mind The only person I ever really truly loved even after my adolescence is David Bowie and he isn t here anymore I want out and I want an easy way out I ll ask the question in the comments section or reddit won t allow me to publish this post ,0
Ending it right nowWhen I was 18 I knew that I would be switching careers I wanted to be in a different field from what I graduated from at university and even said to myself that I ll kill myself at 22 if nothing works out but I have to do my very best in the field I want to switch to But I m already 22 and nothing s working out while I did my best to make it work Every day I feel more and more inadequate of myself I just don t think I should be in this place anymore I only got a few months before I turn 23 I can leave by then ,0

My friends borrowed my money and they re not gave it back to me I feel scam cause I need my money for my school tuition fee What to do ,0
I decided a long time ago life isn t worth living When I was in high school I realized I didn t think life was worth living Logically speaking we can enjoy the good times but we all suffer and go through pain too I don t see the point Why is that worth it Killing myself now might mean missing out on some things but I also will never have to suffer again How could that not be the right choice The only reason I haven t done it yet is because I know the people I care about won t understand and I don t want to hurt them ,0

The title says it all One of my closest friends has depression They re showing some symptoms as well as having a doctor straight up tell them that they have it I just want to help as best as I can What should I do Edit Thank you guys for all the advice I did what you all said and now a new problem has shown up My friend has started to push everyone away What would be the best way to help now ,0
My dilemmaI m depressed but don t want to kill myself so I always distract myself by playing video games and doing things that can keep me occupied but there are responsibilities i have and things I must do otherwise my life gets harder but depression makes it too difficult to me to live like a normal person so I can t even accomplish a thing I m tired of being this miserable I can t keep distracting myself i need to take action but I have no strength to fight back I m always blaming myself for not being able to study like normal people people around me make me feel guilty too like if i m slacking off ,0
Pushing everybody awayMy depression just makes me not want to talk to anybody at all Even when I try it s so forced and inauthentic that I can t nor want to keep even a regular conversation going At this point I have no friends and no one would care if I died right now ,0
Can anyone tell me what a DBT therapist s professionalism looks like My DBT therapist and I were briefly sending texts back and forth yesterday She never answered my direct questions She instead would ask me a different question not acknowledging my questions Today I sent a different question and she did not reply at all She does this same thing in therapy sessions she ignores my questions Is this professional ,0

Wow I am so fucking disappointed A letter to the psychiatric ward I just got released from A metal slab bed and a cardboard pillow is all you get to sleep on and whatever self respect you had left is stripped of you as you walk in the door It seems ironic to me that it took me three days to recover from your refuge of therapy your place of healing I had a grand total of 1 minute 15 seconds of one on one face time with a psychiatrist and a psychologist Watch TV and shut up Eat klonopin until you feel good enough to leave Fuck you this is bullshit ,0
I was thinking jumping from a really high building im talking over 5 storey is that enough Anyways i couldn t find a definitive response online so im asking on reddit i dont want advice how to get over i just dont wanna remain handicapped i dont have a gun and i dont know where to get the pills at so jumping from the top of the building is the best option ,0
Idk what I did wrong in whatever past life to end up mentally ill gay confused and sad but whatever it is clearly someone is hoping I ll off myself If whatever or whoever they are wants me dead they re gonna have to do it themselves and face whatever consequences come with killing me I refuse to give the people who traumatised me an easy pass to discard my exist they will have to live with what they did and the fact I ll do anything to be better than them or kill me themselves Anger is one of the only things that keeps me going which may sound disturbing and sad but it s all I have anymore I have nothing else ,0
I dunno why I m even doing this a Reddit post of my feelings seems stupid but I just need some form of outlet for my thoughts Growing up I had divorced parents went back and forth between mom and dad but as I grew older there was friction between us He didn t like how much I saw my mom which was due to her having more space for me to comfortable live as I used to have to share a room with my brother Every time I went to see him he was always angry or bitter and eventually I just stopped Fast forward years I graduate have my prom move out get a decent job for a kid my age and I get news he had liver failure He was just skin and bones when I saw him Looked nothing like how he used to He couldn t speak much but when he was conscious I told him how sorry I was and how much I loved him The older I get and the more weight that gets put on my shoulders makes me wish I could just sit with him and hear his voice again I miss him so much ,0
I was about to jump the other dayI was stood on top of a bridge and was about to climb up and jump when my friend goes don t do that I dint want to be framed for murder and have to fill out the paper work of seeing you wow thanks so not don t jump because I need you as my friend and need you here just don t do it so I can stay popular,0

I m just done with everything I honestly have been feeling like I have no care to the world that s including my own life it s hard to see any positives and I ve felt super numbed down with emotions lately and just don t see the point of a lot of things that I just say fuck it who cares anymore ,0
I am lost adrift with no hope of rescue and no hope that the future is going to be less terrible The only reason I haven t put my shotgun barrel into my mouth is because I have a wife and kids who are depending on me Antidepressant medication is just barely doing anything and I haven t had luck with therapy I m out of options but to continue on this dead end path to nowhere The world is headed down a spiral to mass death and doom and nobody cares to stop it Everything is hopeless and it doesn t matter I deserve to suffer because I am a member of this accursed species ,0
I feel trapped I keep writing and deleting I don t want to hear what I m thinking All in my head is negatife thoughts for so long I tried to change it so much I don t want to go to psychologist because when I was going through OCD i did and my family threated me in the worst way possible I wish I could get antidepressants Even though I don t know if its the answer,0

Me and my girlfriend split over a month ago and I ve been doing everything all say everyday to distract myself from thinking about it but I cant and the realization of losing her and never getting her back really makes me feel like I dint have a purpose anymore and I couldn t give a shit less what happens to me anymore I just feel weak and alone I cant manage a relationship or my own life anymore,0
Honestly have no idea where to even start I don t know why I m even on Reddit asking for advice about my life I m only 14 First Some people would say I ve been blessed Good family good relationships But these past two years of my life have been so rough Every close friend I have had turn there backs all because of their parents being mad at mine They can t even talk with me And with COVID going on it s worse I really don t know how to feel because it doesn t feel right being sad when There s people out in the world with far worse lives than me But it just hurts having no one anymore It feels like everyone that becomes friends with me somehow leaves I don t really even know anymore ,0
I m rooting for you too Keep going I m so glad I found this sub because when I want to give up I can see that I m not the only one It s comforting somehow,0
I am depressed but i can t tell my parents soSo i ve been getting sadder and sadder with every day and i can t find reasons to get out of bed anymore and i feel like if i tell my parents they re gonna be really worried about me and i don t want that i keep myself from suicide only by thinking your friends are gonna be maybe sad about that ,0
I need help I dont know what to even think anymore None of my friends care what i do or feel people are spreading more rumors about me in school and now my girlfriend is yelling at me because i asked if i could see her sometime in the next week I understand that shes busy with finals and tests but surley theres one day she can work out to see me for half a fucking hour I just have the urge to cut so badly right now I can see the blood and the cuts when i close my eyes I long for it I need it Im done man I can t keep living this hell just to make those around me happy You can call me selfish for wanting to end it but its just as selfish to make me suffer by staying here so they dont have to deal with me gone I dont know how im going to do it today but if i dont get better soon i can tell im going to do something ,0
Over the years I was slowly stripped of everything My interests personality things that gave me joy I ve tried therapy over the course of 12 years i was prescribed 30 drugs and nothing worked I m feeling like a biological robot No feelings no internest no control over my life I have appointment for MRI scan next week but I don t feel like I can make it to that day Im tired I m not myself anymore and I don t believe that anything can help me So what s the point Why shouldn t I end my suffering today ,0
I just want to die No questions asked I just want to die and take 5 minutes for the whole thing ,0
I want to attempt but I want to survive I want to go through it all Being brought to the emergency room getting fixed up having a psych evaluation being put on suicide watch and maybe spend a few days in a psych facility where they watch my every move I don t want my parents to know I don t want really anyone to know But I feel like it just needs to happen I want it to happen and it doesn t make any sense to me But somehow it does I just hope I m not alone in these feelings ,0
I m sad that this is discouraged I mean I get it but still doctors wont help or prescribe meds Family and friends are incapable or unwilling to help Anonymous redditors are probably my last hope ,0
WellFirst of all I m not a native speaker and really bad with words so sry in advance Recently I started thinking about committing suicide I mean I knew I will never really do it because I m really scared and objectively my life is pretty good i just don t know why i can t enjoy it and why i always think I m such a failure It s just seems so logical to end the life because why not Living just means being stressed and have to work 90 of your time All my I would say friends but that s not really the way I see them say if my job fucks me up so much I should do something that I like but that s the problem There is nothing I m really good at and nothing I really enjoy It s like the only thing that keeps me alive is my fear and the guilt of leaving people behind Well I don t really know why I m posting this and what I hope for because out of experience it seems like I can t accept ,0
This is a support space and we have a narrow focus so it s heavily moderated We limit posts to requests for support but our criteria have nothing to do with whether someone has disclosed suicidal behaviour or not As for the larger question this sub exists because in the early days of reddit it was found to be impossible to stop people from posting about their suicidal thoughts and feelings so the harm reduction option was to carve out the safest space we could kind of an oxymoron on a wide open anonymous platform like reddit but we do the best we can and encourage the community to provide non judgemental support The best description that I know of actually came from an outside observer a few years ago but Amanda Hess is an excellent journalist ,0
Its hard to imagine ever being happyI grew up with abusive mom stepdad and an absent dad My sisters banded together and hated me Even now my sisters hate me They aren t vaccinating their children because they don t want them to be autistic like me Everyone in school always hated me My best friend all through high school who became my boyfriend was abusive My now boyfriend who is the only person I have says he wants to be poly one day but is okay with not doing that now He claims that s just how he experiences love that it has nothing to do with me But I can t help but feel that I m not enough Every person in my life has told me I would never be enough for anyone or anything I have no friends no family no job and my physical and mental health is trash I have absolutely nothing to live for I can t imagine ever being happy I have anxiety nearly every single second that I am awake Why is life worth it ,0
Lately i am trying more and more to understand my depression I almost daily get a drunk like feeling despite my last drink being months ago When that feeling comes i feel wobbly on my feet my brain works at like 20 i can t concentrate Sometimes i even feel dizzy Is that a symptom of depression ,0
Of course But we try to provide some education about how to do it effectively We think the only ethical way to do suicide intervention is to help people feel better If you give real understanding and support prevention is a fortunate side effect If you try to change people s minds it usually backfires If you subject someone to an involuntary intervention the traumatic violation often does more harm than good in the long run ,0
If you re reading this a little help A guy died on my watch I keep an eye out on this sub trying to help and yesterday one person killed himself I tried to help him but i failed to convince him And I m very very upset And my anxiety is kicking in I need some help figuring this out I m so conflicted Did I make a mistake Should I stop Please advise I don t care even if it s berating Just tell me your advice ,0

Been a while since I posted on hereA lot has happened since I first went to the hospital I got diagnosed with some things I d already suspected amp got released with meds that would basically fuck with my head if I missed them once The thing is despite my release I still have had no real lust for being alive I probably wouldn t hurt myself but at the same time if something or someone threatened to do me in I probably wouldn t be that phased by it I have no family no friends aside from my roommate no ambitions or aspirations I have no real plan for the future nor do I entirely care My options and interests are fading away but it doesn t feel so bad I have nothing to worry about missing out on or being disappointed by All of the days and nights just blend together constantly tired and unmotivated to do anything But I m still alive so I guess it all worked out maybe ,0
There isn t much time and I need help I ll make this as short as possible I was brought up in a household of narcissists Asian Chinese family with a mom as a teacher and dad as a pastor I m the second of three children I m 24 and moved out a couple of months ago due to the violence and toxicity in the house Right now I m doing my final year in degree and I am not in the right state of mind to continue I m financially crippled and my mental state is spiraling My girlfriend just left me and my close friend insisted that I m not dependent enough and I should learn to be alone I got diagnosed with depression a month ago and the meds just makes me groggy I ve bought a bag of charcoal and taped my room s windows I ve been through so much and I m honestly really tired and I don t know if there s any drive in me to continue living Thanks for reading ,0

The thought that my life is not improving and will not improve makes me want to kill myselfMy high school life was a life I wouldn t wish upon anyone Loneliness stopping infinite fights battles between parents and struggling to score my desired grades I m an international southeast Asia and I know that my life won t improve unless I go to a good college and start a new life My family is already in a lot of debt I ve been a good student throughout my school life My house has been anarchy over the past 6 weeks I couldn t study at all My A Level exams are 4 days away and I cry every time I solve a past paper because I know I ll do bad despite understanding all the tough concepts The fact that I have to stay in this chaos for 5 more years is crippling My A Level grades could ve been the only stand out point for any foreign schools to accept me,0
I get it you are tired but I am too I get it you want to enjoy your life but I want it too But why Why do my parents treat my sister like a princess Why do I have to do the housework Why do I have to clean up her mess Why do I have to cook for her She is unemployed She has time to do all of those I feel like my sister treating me like a slave She told me once that the older siblings treated her like shit but that doesnt mean you can do that to me Today I asked her to clean up her basket and she told me off saying she s tired and she needs to rest I have college tdy and have massive assignments to submit but I make time to do all of the chores To be honest is it too much to ask ,0
I wonder if I was to end it all right now if people would actually care Would people be sad if I was gone Would people actually go to my funeral Would people remember the good times we had together Would they be sad when its around my birthday and they re forced to remember me Would my friends even care Would my mom finally realize that I m sad and not ok ,0
lonelyi feel suicidal and pathetic i have no friends nor love im 20 and i do work going to college and pay for some bills but i feel empty and stupid as life goes on all i think about is wanting love how ugly i am and how my peers have accomplished more in life ive always been the one picked on and unloved in school i barely got any family and was abused as a child i just hate my life im bored of life honestly im sick of it always being lonely it kills me inside ,0
 When your mental health was already pooped and now you got to mourn a loss of a close friend who s not actually dead but they re acting like they are as they completely cut you off 6 month you tried to keep them alive just for them to completely cease contact with you and treat you like it all meant nothing Now it all feels like they have passed even though they haven t And they don t care that it kills your heart to not know if they re ok Wish I could stop feeling and thinking I was hurting before and now I m hurting more and no one gets it Pathetic as it is I just want a hug and for someone to say it ll be ok Even though I know it won t be but for some reason it would still bring me some comfort I ve got no friends to open up to or even discuss things with I m alone have been for years now Been fighting all alone all this time I m so tired ,0
I have no motivation or inspiration Who do I draw I can never think of anything I wish people liked my drawings as much as they like other artists ,0
I ve been working really hard on my mental health for several months now pushing myself through difficult times to keep taking care of myself Recently I started a mood stabilizer that has increased my appetite During my depression my appetite would decrease so it has actually felt really nice to crave food again I don t get pleasure in most of the things that I used to enjoy yet I have been keeping up on my diet exercise sleep and social life despite all this At this point I just of just want to indulge and take a break but doing this doesn t really help in the long term The only indulgence I can think of is pizza and that is a very temporary one that will have a lasting impact on my physical energy for the rest of the day Should I throw the thought of indulgence out of my mind Should I just indulge a little I have no idea at this point,0
Feels like shit can someone talk with me ,0
EDIT i m sure this post has already been made 1000x before my fault I mean I am spiraling out of control and the worst I ve ever been but I can t tell anyone instead I push everyone away from me in a weird way of self harming being self destructive I drink too much refuse therapy and can feel myself loosing grip of reality and control of my life but no one cares so why should I I have all I could ever wish for right Successful in my career a girlfriend new apartment etc still I m at the lowest I ve probably ever been I m 21 but I have a plan for how to kms for the first time since I was 17 and I m worried of how close I am to actually doing it and how easy it would be but I can t do that to my girlfriend and family I ve pushed all my friends away so I don t think they d care too much Sorry for a messy rant I just had to vent,0
If any of you have playlists with songs so make me cry ugly please let me know Any songs like Rnla Broken and paycheck scars are welcome Thanks ,0
I am so sad and lonely I don t have anyone to confide in I want to scream this out loud sometimes I wish someone cared about me the way I cared about them I miss knowing someone actually cared The true kind of caring Where they just care because they love me as a person and nothing else I miss my happy self Idk who that is anymore Idk who I am anymore ,0
Why does life just kick me when I m downLike jesus christ right when my life is actually starting to get back on track it throws the curveball of my girlfirend having breast cancer Why can t I just be happy for once ,0
I feel somewhat lostSo life has been a real roller coaster for the past couple of weeks and some things have changed of course And i got off seronil because it made me feel like i m not alive Socially things are super fucking great at this moment But the real problem kicks in when i actually do feel like okay and stuff but still id love to just disappear so i could get my head straight Because like i said things are okay but there is still a lot on my mind Id love to just get a break from everything and get things sorted in my head I don t know i guess it sounds pretty stupid out loud but that s really how i feel What do you guys think love yall J,0
We ve been together for a year He is polyamorous and I knew that when we started dating I told him I will stay for as long as I am happy He is still the nicest guy I ve ever dated Our conversations are the best and he is the most considerate person I know I m his favourite he says I m a priority for him he says But I am not THE priority I am falling in love with him and I can no longer deny that I am jealous and angry and sad when he sees his other partners I need to leave this relationship but I love him and the thought of leaving hurts so much But I have to because I want someone who will love me and only me He isn t that someone No matter how well he treats me He will never love only me I get it I don t judge him for it But my heart is broken and although I knew it would come to this I don t regret loving him But now I have to leave ,0
Lost my job last month struggling with depression OCD and alcoholism Family is worried about me Had a friend tell me she doesn t want to hang out until I get sober Been looking into rehab and plan on doing inpatient soon I just feel really discouraged and things won t get better I don t plan on killing myself but wouldn t care if something happened to me ,0

Mentally disabled but physically strong I will die by suicide because I can t survive Im tired of trying I exercise I have hobbies I am unloved At my family s mercy They left me homeless before I can t fucking take it I m tired of being single I am giving it my fucking all but my abusers have fucking great lives and I m going to die alone ,0
How much Does anyone know if 25 Percocets will do anything other than just make me throw up a bunch Would this be enough possibly drowned out with alcohol Thanks,0
The whole show my mom puts that you can come to me when you want someone to talk to is bullshit When really she is fed up with me and expects me to know everything in life I can t share what I feel because I know what I ll get Either the whole god cares about you and good things will happen soon or the whole get over it and just be happy boomer mentality At least my dad doesn t lie and is just emotionally unavailable I am just going to close up ,0
The main reason I haven t is the stigma I wish people were brought up to think of suicide as a person s respectable decision that they have a right to The culture seems to have the majority opinion that it is a weak thing to do that someone should feel guilty about because of the suffering it will cause other people I know that if I killed myself there would be so many people that would judge me and think that something was wrong with me I hate to give them the power to judge me like that ,0
I don t even know if I want anyone to respond Had a fight with my wife But seems pretty terminal Just want yo turn all the lights off ,0
Sometimes I wish I could just have at least a hug before I try to kill myselfJust a hug Someone to tell me that it s ok that I m not as horrible of a person as I think I am but it s not ok and I am a horrible person so that s not gonna happen I try so hard so fucking hard to not hurt people to try to make people feel better to help where I can to be a friend or anything someone asks of me but life always finds a way to shit on me I only wanted a few things out of life someone to love someone who loves me and maybe to be happy I didn t ask to be born I didn t ask for this life I don t want it anymore Someone please end this for me or I ll do it myself ,0
I m just exhausted at this pointI m just so tired I ve attempted to take my life multiple times but in the end I fail and feel even worse for it I tried last night too and I just Fuck man I m just tired I want to get professional help but can t where I live I know that if something doesn t change now I won t last I m so tired of feeling so alone all the time and breaking down and feeling numb I m tired of this cycle and if I don t get better I know I ll kill myself Can anyone please site any sources or support groups or anything like that I won t be able to pay cuz I m a minor I m just so tired of this shit man I want to get better I want to be ok for once in my miserable fucking life ,0
Okay so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesn t mix well when you re already depressed but I wouldn t think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad Long story short went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got It was fun these are people I like and things were starting to get a bit better for me Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic found an advisor for my master s thesis But at a certain point maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped I just wasn t there I left didn t say goodbye to anyone attempted to bike home and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike I m usually a little bit of an emotional drunk but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them It s never been this I ve never felt this outside of my own experience Thoughts ,0
Is there anything besides calling suicide help line that I can do or am I hopelessI m in a same state as most of you guys and I ve called suicide help so many times and i always get the same old response it doesn t help me How do you guys keep going I could use any suggestion I don t care,0
Why do I feel this way My heart feels like it s collapsing in on my stomach I m getting lost in my feelings right now since there s so much going on with them I adore this girl but I m afraid it ll never work out and I m always debating whether or not I should keep trying I ve always had the feeling that I m never good enough for every female I meet and end up falling in love Why do I do this to myself I always have this nagging feeling that it ll hurt when she stops talking to me and there s nothing I can do about it it just passes me by so quickly that I can t catch my breath I feel so alone when I m without her and it s starting to hurt me every day whether it s an hour or four I can t seem to stop myself from missing her so much ,0
I got the bad eating disorder ,0
And I never know when a bad day is coming I could be having a great week and suddenly it all just hits me I then have no motivation to do anything constantly tired see no meaning in living just wanna stare at a wall while on the verge of tears Here is where I am at the moment I haven t seeked help since its not always like this Some days I m feeling great but theres no balance in my life And I don t know what to do about it I ve tried journaling exercise meditation and that kind of stuff but it isn t helping ,0
I don t do my workouts anymore I was in a bad accident and my life took a major turn for the worse A lot of issues in still dealing with today even though it happened more than three years ago I don t want to try I don t want to feel I don t want to exist I used to want to get better to be able to live my life again and now I just don t even feel like there s anything valuable to go back to I m not really looking for advice I just wish I could have something to look forward to Instead I ll just make this post in hopes I might feel a little bit relieved from this extreme void of self hate and despair ,0
i m not sure if i should be ending my misery as soon as possible or wait until there s less covid cases in hospitals so i can sign up to be an organ donor and finally end up useful i find myself extremely useless and pathetic,0
Feels like no one really cares about meJust drank some alcohol and harmed myself i m so alone i cried all day and fantasized about suicide,0
Can t do it anymoreGenuinley need to kill myself now its gotten to the point where if i need help and message someone about it they always try It ll get better or You are loved don t worry but none of that shit helps i don t see why I shouldn t commit suicide its easy enough to find a way to do it also even if i message someone about it and they don t reply it just means i have no one to talk to about it which usually leads to me burning and crying along with thinking of ways to die,0
does anyone else cry because they don t have anyone that loves them like you do but not the people you actually want just me ok ,0
I don t see any point to being alivei m fucking miserable all the time i m so lonely it literally hurts i have no one to talk to i genuinely hate everything about who i am and what i look like what s the point of living if it s going to be like this ,0
i can t take a course in music and arts if i fail math that consists of fucking useless formulas i m supposed to memorise so i can appease some dogshit bureaucrats who think they know what s best for everyone fuck this at least it gives me a reason to die ,0
I really want things to get better Its been years now but i m still suffering And I know exactly why i m depressed Its because of my mom She only cares about her self she abandoned me once actually to be with some guy I need to beg her for things that I need and its making me feel miserable because why do i need to beg her for her responsibilities I just want to leave honestly but i know i can t because i m still a minor and i need to finish school to have a decent job and im not even sure if im gonna be able to finish school because she just doesn t care at all I just really want all this things to end i didn t choose to be here so why am i suffering ,0

So I ve been in these forums trying to help as much as I can while battling this mo fo depression It s been a year of fight Some goods days most bad days But something in me always told me to keep fighting That something has burned out I can feel a new depth of hollowness in me I am assured there is no more love life for me Best part the woman I love she met someone And I think he is good for her I havent seen her happy for so long And I don t want to destroy her life too In movies we see the hero throwing away everything to confess his love but in real life I have nothing to begin with to throw away I don t have any money lost my business seperated from my wife who I wish is happy So you see there is nothing more for me I ve done my part in this world Only thing to do is disappear I just want to vanish from this world asap If anyone can help me let me know Just a fast death That s the only thing I genuinely genuinely wish for me Getting off Reddit Adi s brothers and sisters it was a hell of a ride ,0

DefectiveSeraph if you see this I m sorry I doubt you ll even check if I posted any more here though My life s purpose is to simply make a few people on this Earth s lives a little less shitty and if I can t even do that tiny amount of existence right then it s time for me to go ,0
As a quiet person who s dealt with many mental health issues and is generally stuck inside my own head I enjoy being quiet observing a lot and not being a socially obnoxious twat who feels the need to speak just because Why do people act like being quiet is a weird thing Just annoys the hell out of me and makes me instantly dislike the person that s all rant over ,0
How come people who enjoy life die all the time while those of us who desperately want out could probably survive a nuclear fallout Wtf universe ,0

why are suicide rates so low it s 01 in america 1 out of 10 000 ppl and most of them are old ppl or ppl in indian reservations i don t understand maybe because i have major depression but 1 out of 10 000 seems so low it makes me feel like shit like im the weakest person out of 10 000 people,0
I m dumbI m dumb amp ugly Not suicidal Just venting ,0
A friend of mine is having a lot of thoughts about committing suicide lately And apparently I m the only one who knows about them Plus I see him getting closer and closer to rock bottom I feel like I have to do something but I don t really know what and clearly he doesn t know what it would take for me not to do it either What do I do ,0
I agree and I appreciate scorpionstanks and others good intentions It s amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression But agency community contact is important Everyone gets compassion fatigue Having seen and heard our crisis coordinators some of the most compassionate individuals I ve met after a 12 hour shift And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift ,0
I m the backup plan in everything i do Nobody has ever seen me as their first choice I ve tried so hard over the years to better myself in countless ways but the feeling never goes away I wish I had a best friend I wish I was in the first wave of invites for get togethers I wish I could find a girlfriend who doesn t cheat on me when someone better is available I wish my bosses wouldn t pass on giving me the promotion I ve worked so hard to earn I wish I could prove to someone anyone that I m worth it but how can I when I don t even feel that way about myself ,0
I just feel so utterly empty and alone Do you guys ever feel like this It feels like there is a black hole inside of me slowly eating away at me and taking my soul I m 22 and I can t make friends or get a girlfriend The loneliness just gets more crushing every day,0
I can t even afford a rope to hang myselfDepression has crippled me I am about to become a financial burden on my loved ones and I can t take it I am no longer able to support myself I would prefer death At least then I could retain some dignity Talking to someone isn t going to remove the sting of failure from my mind I m on medication for years it made a positive impact but I m losing the fight I don t know who I m talking to Maybe posting this will get the pain out somehow I m sick with the anxiety I feel like I ve done this to myself I ve no real trauma just 20 years of feeling shit ,0
I ve been talking with some of my friends about my depression and anxiety and they will tell me they genuinely do like me But then my brain will go they didn t say hi to you at a party they don t actually like you or they re taking a while to respond probably bc they don t want to And I know they do because they ll actively engage with me and ask me to do things Does anyone else feel like this ,0

whats the point of continuing a mundane life if every fucking day is thr same im so tired and so so so bored im not suicidal because im sad im suicidal because i dont see the point and no matter what i do i will never make an impact mo matter what i do therapy doesnt work my meds dont work im just stuck in an endless cycle of hopelessness its so hard to enjoy the things i used to enjoy all i have are my stupid hyperfixations and they will be gone one day too i just feel like everyone else would be better off if i disappear off of the face of the earth i only ever make people worse versions of themselves and i treat people so horribly i just feel like i was put on this earth to suffer and cause suffering im so sick i just want it to stop i hate it here,0
Why do we punish those who seek help I want to seek help but I can t because of my military status and law school I have to fear punishment for doing the right thing and losing both my current and future career I m so frustrated and I m so upset that I m going to die because I can t trust the system not to screw me People can say they won t but there s no guarantee and those words won t pay the bills if I lose my career I m 99 sure there s something more serious than depression lurking possibly something on the autism spectrum or a personality disorder That s an automatic discharge from the military and since it would be pre existing I would get no benefits despite almost a decade of service And there s no way the bar will allow a lawyer with autism or a personality disorder I m utterly fucked looking at the GWB as my way out ,0
I always read that telling people you trust is the best option for getting help but it just feels meaningless when they tell me I should think about my future and how I should fight for my life when I m suicidal Literally all I see for my future is suicide and if not then unemployed pathetic still relying on my parents etc I feel like a baby that isn t trying and I m convinced that I really am just lazy and not trying but why should I when I see no point in it I plan to kill myself soon anyways None of it will matter You just get mad and insult or laugh at me when I tell you that so I won t and your eyes are always filled with judgement I don t get why you don t want to tell me to kill myself instead of going through the struggle of telling me why I shouldn t,0
Lost my fianc Feeling terribleI did something stupid a long time ago I didn t cheat on her but I broke our trust in a fashion We worked through it then she broke up with me quite a while after Pretty out of nowhere We were SO happy together She s an amazing woman and we had an amazing relationship This was about two months ago and I am feeling more and more lost daily I haven t been in contact with her or seen her since I want her back so bad but I know if we re gonna get back together that it has to be on her to reach out I feel terrible daily and contemplate what it would be like to end it Part of me feels like this whole thing is my fault and that I ruined a great thing The other part knows that she shouldn t have just up and left That this isn t me and the root issue is her cold feet I am scared of the future ,0

Just to add on a bit to what said feeling genuinely cared about and understood without judgement is the most important factor that could make this feel like good support rather than incitement It s also easier for a friend to compensate for mistakes if someone takes something the wrong way In an online context like SW where people are usually talking with strangers and misunderstandings can be harder to fix and also where voyeurs frequently just say you have the right to do it or similar without even trying to ease anyone s suffering it s even more important to offer empathetic support for the reasons people are thinking about suicide in the first place as the talking tips indicate in addition to not judging suicidal thoughts ,0

What is the point in trying I can t do anything right Can t go for my final year of high school because it s too overwhelming for me Can t find a job that I can handle with my anxiety disorder Can t find a single medication that works Can t find a councillor who doesn t make me feel worse Can t find any person who does just say don t worry about it Stop stressing You ll be fine as if I have a choice to feel this way Can t find a reason to live I m a white privileged teenager who complains of nothing to make it something I harm the only body I have as if it will help me and I dream of suicide as if I have it bad when I know so many have it worse I don t deserve to live if I m such a low life piece of shit who isn t grateful for the life she has There s nothing here for me and nothing my depression wouldn t ruin anyway Im alone It will hurt people if I die but I m selfish enough to stop living because it hurts me ,0
I just find myself so useless I ve been dealing with social anxiety others may find it easy to go out to work but not for me It s really stressful whenever I think about going out to work Even if I have a job I find it meaningless too to wake up at 7am for a 9am job reaches home at 7pm only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you gotta get up early next day again that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially but that s not working out Now that our breadwinner has passed on we re left with a huge debt for housing loan and also suffering from monthly utilities bills Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family Others look down on me Since I m so useless I m slowly losing my will to live I just want to leave and go to a happier world ,0
No more not anymoreIf you seen my other posts on here you are probably sick of my whining I have suffered for so long and hurt myself as a way to release the strong energy ordering me to end it all but that s only temporary This energy was to strong for me the other night and I attempted but I failed and I was a coward I just want it to be quick and mostly painless at least then the world will be rid of me and me of it and I can see my puppy again ,0

I really need a hug Sappy slim on details Move along That s it I it s a VERY long story and perhaps this isn t the appropriate place to put this if it isn t mods feel free to delete but I just broke up with the only person who showed me actual love and affection it s been almost a week I m alone numb emotionally hurting physically I m trying to make ends meet out of work and without her or her friends to rely on in any sense of the word Went to find my username for reddit in my gmail and the only hit that came up was a chat with her when we were still together I really want to die but between crippling anxiety awareness of the poor success rates for suicide prior attempt and lack of a gun I understand this isn t a reasonable option and am thus not suicidal ,0
I m so sick and tired of everything Everything drains my mind Whether I m momentarily happy or sad Nothing satisfies me anymore I ve lost interest in the shows I used to watch I make music but even that seems bleak and pointless at the moment I cannot get myself to commit suicide but I really wish this life comes to an end When I walk down the road I wish that a vehicle runs me over When I m riding my bike I wish I come across an accident and die When I sleep I wish that peacefully pass away I do have aspirations and goals in mind but honestly I don t think I have the mental capacity to endure through ,0

I show no love to myself In fact I blame myself for everything I shame myself for my own actions I don t believe in myself I hate myself So much so that if my reflection jumped out of a mirror I would attack me and fight me until one of us was dead to which the victor would still be me and still be alone And come to the realization that there is a new me in the mirror and one can only ever kill the other leaving one left There is no way to completely extingish myself for good I m doomed to keep killing myself without relief I m miserable ,0

I have been battling depression since I was a child long back story and have managed to get through tough episodes with the help of exercise and creative outlets However this past year has put me into a very tough state of mind to get out of made worse by the pandemic I ve had mental breakdowns that have led me to almost commit suicide within the past 6 months as well But on top of that I am engaged to someone with ADHD and it s also been difficult to cope with his symptoms He is an amazing man and goes the extra mile for me always but It s hard for me to show my appreciation with my depression and also not build resentment against him because of how he is as a person with ADHD talks over me forgets details constantly doesn t really listen to me and does something else while I m in mid sentence I just need advice on how to manage a healthy relationship I think because both of our mental illnesses are starting to ruin our relationship ,0

Feel like I cant copeHi this is my first time posting on Reddit long time lurker basically I feel like I m going crazy and its been gradually getting more unbearable for the past year before I was depressed but I still had a sense of self I feel detached from reality my thoughts frighten and confuse me I m unable to have any emotions and feel tense all the time I ve started drinking pretty much every night to try and cope and get to sleep I m having a hard time finding any meaning to go on when I m unable to get any enjoyment from life anymore all I do is go to work come home and sit in my room and the longer this has been going on the more helpless I feel I ve tried getting help but I just think negatively about it and criticize the people and medication that could help me I ve had suicidal thoughts for years but now they re starting to feel different like I m really considering it as a way out not that I want to die I just cant cope with feeling this way for much longer ,0
For the past few years I ve lost a few people in life such as my ex boyfriend and my ex best friend They both used to be the ones who supported me But probably left me due to my attitude Sometimes I get angry when people are doing better than me And I have less empathy Probably that s the reason why I have no friends and people keep leaving me My parents won t understand me When I told them about this all they wanted me to do is to just smile and be positive But it s not easy for me because I like company and I like people to care about me And those people Left These thoughts also led me to suicidal thoughts like I should just leave this world knowing that I will be lonely for the rest of my life ,0
I go to sleep every night thinking of drinking rat poisonI ve even become immune to what my family and fiance will feel My family will slowly get over it My sister might find it difficult to deal with it but who will miss me past a year tops Pretty sure my fiance will find someone new and move on People at work won t care I m mostly dumb and invisible anyway In fact they might even laugh about what a waste of a life I am It s sad because it was a job in my dream area But I sucked at it I am tired of being this extremely dumb physically defective absolute failure with a lack of cognitive function and creative ability I wish I could die in my sleep The world needs smart people and I m just a waste of space ,0

I m in my 20s have a great job university degree goals for the future beautiful fiancee but I m afraid I m scared that it ll all be for nothing once I die Like what s the point if it ll just disappear in the end I m so attached to what I have now that I m afraid to be without it after I die I m a paramedic and I see death sometimes It hurts me the most to imagine how loved ones must feel when they lose somebody close to them The thought of losing my partner or leaving her without me absolutely crushes me My parents are getting very old and sick and I ve never felt loss anything like what I imagine it will feel like when they go I guess I m just really afraid of dying and losing everything I ve worked towards I don t know what happens after death I m not religious I hope I don t just lose all consciousness of everything that happened in my life because I want to love those close to me forever even after I die ,0

No friends and no family Nobody checks in on me nobody puts in any effort I m pathetic mediocre at best and have no future to speak of It s so humiliating to write this but I don t know what else to do The therapists I ve seen have all made it worse and medication always sends me into a tailspin I ve been physically abused by my father and two intimate partners but whenever I talk about it I feel ashamed or weak as though it s my fault for letting it happen Nobody seems to care and I want to stick a gun down my throat and end it I feel like the only reason I don t is because the people that know me would just shake their heads and act repulsed one last time ,0
I think rejection hurts me more than it should Even just thinking about being rejection even when nothing has happened gives me a burning urge to self harm or attempt suicide I think part of the problem is that I ve only experienced rejection when it comes to intimacy and this has warped my perspective I think having a positive experience where i m accepted would be the best solution but that seems like a longshot Is there anything I can do to make myself less vulnerable ,0

Hello I m a 17yr old bisexual male in india The last few months I was feeling really sick but didn t have any symptoms so my friend asked me to take a couple of psych tests and they all came back saying I m moderately depressed or severely depressed I have been feeling suicidal for about 3years now ever since I faced bullying in my old school and was hospitalized for liver failure because I tried to kill my self with pills This was 3 years ago Every thing since then has felt extra I lately haven t been able to do anything about it because of my studies I can t seek help because if i tell my parents they will simply discard it saying it s an excuse not to study they re wired that way and I don t have enough money on my own to seek help indipendently Im clueless as to what I m supposed to do,0
Will these thoughts ever go away When I wake up in the morning I go through my routine I look out my windows shower think and eat so I can take my medications I go through my day with intrusive thoughts of suicide and search for the reason why I don t have family and I m recovering from emotional neglect and the passing of my toxic parent that I had been a care taker for a few years In those few years I got to see who they were their fears worries and what made them happy It was a bittersweet gift to be able to connect with them and for the first time i felt as though I had a family Then they died suddenly and I watched it happen This person I viewed as a parent friend and child died Wham Their face was flat on the floor and the gasping is still in my mind repeating It has been a year and I m still having night terrors and guilt And now the holidays bring this cold and desolate feeling that I can t seem to shake I feel like I want to give up on it all I just don t want to wake up tomorrow ,0

Pain has outweighed hope Any good videos or advice on suicide All I have got to say is pain has outweighed hope I can t imagine being happy All the times I have been happy it has been temporary There are certain realities of life that are just so unjust that convinces me living is pointless The people I have let in have failed me I have failed me for being unable to validate myself I don t want to be on this planet it s a waste of time ,0

I wish someone would do it for me I m too much of a wimp to commit suicide I just wish someone would walk up to me and shoot me without the person getting caught They probably wouldn t get caught anyway it s not like anyone would even notice that I was gone Maybe someone will do the deed for me one day but until then I guess I ll just live in this hell we call life,0
My parents have supported me this past year and its dragging on them even if they wouldnt admit it I made some recent mistakes that will cause me to miss the next semester of college because I cant afford it I am planning to leave a note saying I need to leave my current life situation I think this will be easier on them I am not looking for help but I feel like I need to post this to at least let somebody know what I am feeling before I move on with this part of my life ,0
So an old friend invited me to his farewell party I normally don t get invites like this but he was going away to another country to be honest we were never that close because we went to different Universities but I get along well with him It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys the whole night I felt so zoned out I felt horrible that I wasn t being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded the alcohol made it even worse One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night I felt crushed I gave the usual a xcuse of I m tired but it was difficult not to leave right away I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially I came home and cried yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party I feel like I m just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser I give up even trying anymore I m tired of it ,0
someone to talk Its been a while since I had this strange and distant feeling towards life But the events of the last like six months lead me more and more into suicide Ive been there before thought about alot in my youth but this time it isnt about attention I mean i guess it was at the beginning but I stopped talking about it and now the feeling intensifies I feel left alone but I left everbody I feel angry and sad about me I stopped working out let myself go drink smoke i know lift your head up but I cant because everytime I think its okay now something happens and most likely im the one who fucked up that makes me tired What should I do Clearly im not in the shape to decide myself its so hard to admit that I made myself my biggest struggle and I only can think of this one way out,0

 if you don t have a goal life is a chore My goal is to kill myself Life sucks and I don t have the courage to say it all again but life is overshit and I have reached the state where I don t think about killing myself but now I am at the step where you think when to do it and how to do it I don t see any other way I guess if I ring suicide hotline they will bring me to a mental ward in france so no point My parents call me selfish if I tell them that x200B WHY THE FUCK IS IT SELFISH FOR ME TO KILL MYSELF but not selfish for them to ask me to stay alive for their happiness ,0
I just want to say that it s awesome that this community exists I by no means have suicidal thoughts never have but it occured to me that even though I m comfortable in life all I can say is that while I used to not understand why people do it I can see now how it happens I find how we handle this issue unacceptable as a society so I am wondering if it is possible to work as an anti suicide counselor part time as a student in the military I ask because we have student EMTs so why not alleviate a shift on a hotline or something or is that generally seen as too much responsibility for a part time worker ,0
Had my dad drop me off at the mall today Was feeling awful and impulsively walked up to the top of the parking thing and looked over the edge I put my left foot onto the edge of the wall and told myself this was the hardest part and if I could get through this im home free It s really scary though It s not easy at all Not only did the height look just high enough to paralyze me but just not quite high to kill me the thought of jumping is extremely daunting I dont think ill ever get it done this way I might go back up a few times before my dad comes to get me to familiarize myself with the thought Obviously not asking for a more reliable way to kill myself just thought id share an interesting experience I had Also called the Suicide Hotline but hung up Heard bad things about them and the last thing I need is a professional patronizing and demeaning me ,0
Sometimes I wonderSometimes I wonder if death is better College is getting too much for me and even if I graduate I ll be in massive debt I don t know if I even have what it takes to survive in this world My mom ruined that for me by keeping me isolated as a child And the majority of my family doesn t really care about me I don t like my skin color anyway and the only way to get rid of it is to bleach it which will be damaging What s the point in being alive when you don t even like the appearance you re born with But every time I think of suicide I hear the ringing bell on the collar of my kitten If I didn t have the kitten I probably wouldn t mind taking my own life ,0
Then I realize that friends are an artifical construct engineered by our psyche to suppress the existential dread of mindlessly wandering through the universe without meaning significance or consequence Then I really miss the feeling of being around friends ,0
People suck I just want somebody to love me and take me seriously ,0
helpLife just seems so pointless to continue now I tell myself over and over soon this pain will stop and perhaps it ll be okay But today this desire of suicide grows I m fighting it but there s no one to go to for help no matter how much I want it I try to do the things I like but I can t They just don t make me happy anymore Nothing makes me happy anymore and I just don t know what to do Is there anything I can do so I can distract myself from this pain at least for now ,0

I met a man or so I thought We started hanging out almost every day I really enjoyed his company Told me that he loved me told all my friends that he wanted me I didn t want a relationship but we were pretty casual He wanted sex it was a no for me Nevertheless he was so demanding that the foreplay got more intense every time We did that for over a month We started arguing more often especially about sex Yesterday I was drunk I texted him he started acting distant I wanted to fix things between us He finally came pretty late we did foreplay we laughed we had fun I though everything was going to be back to normal I text him today Doesn t reply the whole day Got to his apartment I could hear his voice from the alley meaning that he was talking to someone I was hesitant but I finally knocked at the door He opened and said Hey I am with my girlfriend right now ,0
l There should be another way for ppl to come to this world No one deserves to come to this world without their previous consent So what should I do Like I was sent to be born in a poor family I grew up surrounded by poverty careless parents and lack of opportunities So what do I do in a situation like that I was a difficult kid a difficult teen and ofc now I am a difficult adult I don t see any expectation of improvement I don t see myself rich full of money I don t see myself being happy So how am I supposed to live a life full of sorrows poverty and failures This is not what I want for me I wish I was born in a rich family of successful businesspeople or celebrities and well life gave me two poor narcissistic teens instead Nice ,0

FoolproofI know they say there is no 100 foolproof method but i think this is as close as it can get really So going up to a very tall building and sitting on the edge then putting a gun to the roof of my mouth and firing If it doesn t kill me on impact which i doubt the fall 40 stories down will finish the job And hopefully i won t be conscious to experience the fall And just for fun take a load of barbiturates before i do the deed Pretty foolproof right No need for suicide hotline numbers or anything like that Not acting on this until later in life Opinions ,0

So I tried to talk to my family about depressionIt went as well as you expected it to be A lot of screaming feeling blame for the issues not getting any understanding regarding going to a medical professional and if that wasn t enough my sister tried to give me a religious speech because in her words you won t be able to solve your problems without god I don t know my dudes I was just expecting to get some support but it turned into a big fight were I was the bad guy I ve been contemplating offing myself a little recently but today made it a lot worse Gonna get that therapy regardless of what my family thinks ,0

Sadly it s mostly on you to dig yourself out even with meds and therapy Meds help with energy and motivation If you find the right one or combo therapy can help with strategy and where to start but yeah there is no magic pill or spell to pull you out Just you pulling and dragging yourself out but yeah the reach out but I will give you 15 minutes once in awhile part sucks very much Good luck OP Keep trying with whatever you can muster ,0
Did anyone tried to kill themselves just to make the point for people to leave them alone I am bullied and it s getting worse I am supporting myself by telling my life is not worth of them and what they say I have suicidal thoughts for a few years and tried to kill myself I change my mind in last minute I don t know why but people are insulting me and I don t have someone in my life on who I can lean on I hope everything will be over soon because I don t see the point of being here when so much people hate me I tried my best to be kind to everyone and to help everyone I am so sorry I couldn t take it anymore ,0

So I m a gamer and I m okay with it I like to listen to game music because I think it sounds better than regular music half of which is either about breakups or alcoholism Anyway today over dinner my family started relentlessly making fun of me for liking this music I put up a game face for them but inside it actually made me feel so alone and depressed How do I deal with this A conflict of interests is surprisingly hard to deal with especially when I m the only one on my side,0
Starting plansIt s gotten to bad to recover I can t explain all that s happened to me I m too embarrassed I know I ll never be loved how I am now physically or mentally Maybe before it all happened but not now Looking into the suicide bag method currently Idk where to order the tanks since party city has there s cut with extra oxygen to prevent this sort of thing I know there are good people out there People who are meant for this world But if the world makes people who they are is it not just circumstance they became good bad Maybe there environment or nurture Therefore if someone was raised up horribly is it truly there fault for ending it are they damned to hellfire Really Where is the moral in this I can t find it I m ready to leave We all are ready to just fucking leave ,0

I ve been suicidal for like 5 years now I say suicidal and not suicidal because although I want to die and I regularly think about how and where I d do it I knew I never would I m not so sure now I ve had a really shit time with family at the moment Not anything particularly bad It s not nice hearing that you re a burden from your own mother though 17f btw I ve always been really close with her and she s probably one of the only people who have actively kept me alive and the only person I can really speak to and it feels like everything around me is shattered into a million pieces I feel so unstable and honestly I feel like I m gonna get in one of those mind frames and I m scared I won t be able to stop it I m currently unable to get counselling etc I ve been in contact with my doctor recently and since it became a problem Any comments would be greatly appreciated I just wanna get my life together ,0
How do I figure out if I deserve help I mean mostly deserve a therapist s time to work with a patient Do I deserve their time regardless of the money I pay them I just have too many questions for them nbsp Also does it sound illogical when I say that I don t want to take deep breaths and calm myself because that means ignoring the anxiety and treating it like something that s overreacting that needs to be fixed Treating the anxiety as wrong not okay I thought you should treat the anxiety as a friend and live with it Not shush it from the conscience Thanks ,0

i have schizophrenia and i feel very isolated i have been reading the stories in this reddit thing and it makes me sad but also relieves me that there are plenty others who feel that their time is near this may sound a bit morbid but maybe sometimes we dont need to live maybe we dont have a choice if we are born but we should have a choice to end it if we so desire trouble is that if the attempt does not work you are at risk of being institutionalized and the truth is those facilities or at least the ones ive been in are far from therapeutic i wish i could be a normal person with a normal brain who does not think of dying and the ways in which to do so almost if not all day is there anyone who feels the same i find myself to be cowardly nowadays when it comes down to doing what i need to do i think that is because i have attempted and failed so many times anyway i hope this message reaches somebody out there thanks ,0

Not temporaryI feel like every time I talk to someone or I seek help on a website I m told that my suicidal thoughts are a permanent solution to a temporary problem But this isn t temporary As long as I can remember I have hated who I am as a person I ve hated my personality and so had everyone else I ve tried to change it for 22 years but I can t I ve tried therapy medication treatment it all just numbs the feelings When I want to cry and I can t get tears out and I know it s just because the medication stops the tears but not the underlying hatred I have of myself No one likes me and I understand why I don t like myself either And i can t find a way to fix that ,0

Anything on adjustment issues moving definitely deprived me of an optimistic outlook on relationships throughout most of my adolescence inferiority complex and imposter syndrome focusing on studies due to being a slow learner decreased my efforts in trying out extracurriculars and hanging out with friends I feel like I m in a weird limbo where I know that I ve performed well to get diplomas but not in real life reducing apathy to get back to my favorite hobbies I m not looking for a miracle cure I could go to a therapist but cannot afford it in the long term I tried looking up things online but feel like many people who reviewed presented any books and YouTube videos don t really understand that depression exists as a spectrum continuous with so many levels factors triggers pain thresholds I m hoping that people who really experienced and identify with some of the points on my list could recommend me some things that worked for them x200B Thanks ,0

I haven t slept so good before in a whileReasons to live I have only an handful As these days awaken I think about them dreams and the broken ones The life soon to wandered have never felt so close to an end The joys of being loved and the horrors of being betrayed is just a couple of feelings that may surround the universe As these days awaken I always learn that the dark in only present when no light is shed ,0

Seriously overdosing isn t that bad I ve tried once and if I didn t get saved I could be free x200B I don t remember the last time my dreams and wishes didn t involve suicide I don t want anything from life only death I could get a perfect life tomorrow and I wouldn t care I just want death x200B I wish I could sign some sort of agreement that would prohibit people from taking me to the hospital after a suicide attempt I wouldn t have to worry about anything I d just take the pain and wait for the end x200B I can t help but resent anyone who tries to save me from suicide It s selfish to want someone to continue suffering just because you wish so,0

Hi guys I m a 18F and I feel like I m falling back into a state of depression I feel like part of it is because it s summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do Throughout the day I m just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I m not necessarily suicidal I don t really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends This gives me some joy but then after it s done I fall back into that sad state I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I don t deserve to be depressed or sad I don t have any financial struggles and I have a pretty good relationship with family and friends I m hoping that once fall semester starts I ll be out of this rut and instead be stressed about school LOL Anyways thank you to anyone that actually reads this and listened to my rant ,0

My depression is getting worse and worse every day it seems I ll have really great days but as soon as things start going well it just crashes and I cannot handle it anymore I can t get these bad thoughts out of my head and I cannot take the loneliness that s constantly there if I m just with my own thoughts My mind races nonstop that I don t matter and no one will ever stick around because well everyone s left before so how could I trust literally anyone else I feel like I m constantly breaking down and it makes me physically sick I m at work today alone and I just keep thinking to end it and it just will not stop I don t have anyone I m comfortable enough with to call or express these feelings with And I honestly can t afford therapy right now I just feel like it s all coming to an end and I can t stop it ,0

I ve been talking to this guy for about a month now and we liked each other emotionally and sexually but he made it clear he didn t know if he wanted a relationship with me For some reason I just didn t know what to do so I just kept talking to him I was in no rush since I did like him We hung out once and afterwards he ghosted me He wouldn t talk to me privately anymore And about two weeks later he told me he just wanted to be friends It makes me think that maybe I m ugly or uninteresting to the point where he didn t want me anymore ,0

Why shouldn t ISo a year or so ago I posted on here   with a post of the same name Here I am a year later and still alive but the situation is worsened I got fired from my job a few weeks ago for cause At this point the only reason I haven t already offed myself is my brother He would will he hurt when I do this and I consider it a when not an if One of the reasons I have made it this far is my job I have always thought that at least I had some value to society from being a contributing factor through my work Well now my boss has decided that contribution is no longer valid When I posted previously the only people that will miss me will be my brother my work and my tenant The work is no longer an issue and they have declared me as worthless My brother will miss me but as a practical matter I have little if any influence on his day to day life is negligible at best So why shouldn t I put a gun under my chin and aim well back and pull the trigger ,0

It feels like everyday even if I have a good day at the end I feel so shitty and I can t take it I feel so ungrateful and stupid for not being happy by myself I keep feeling so empty no matter how hard I work to be positive and happy I can barely survive daily challenges And everytime I try to open up to anyone their automatic response the generic don t worry you ll be fine like I know people mean well but I don t think they really understand the severity of how bad I feel and how alone I felt for my entire life With or without anyone I am always alone I ve resorted to writing on here cause I really have no one to will listen and even if I explain this to my therapist she ll just refer me to new meds which I don t want I want to be happy again just to be alive I want to feel like life is a blessing and not a curse I m just so tired,0

I have undiagnosed anxiety disorder and possibly depression too Been wanting to be treated but scared to admit it to my family I m worried that they aren t gonna take it seriously or make fun of me And today I heard my father talking to his doctor on speaker I eavesdropped the whole conversation He was told that he has depression and anxiety He was prescribed medication for anxiety and sleeping pills and that was it Nothing about therapy or anything I want to get treated but I don t wanna only rely on medications I m quite worried and disappointed because I don t think I or my father would get better that way Is this normal to only prescribed with medication for depression and anxiety without any therapy Have any of you here experienced this before I m not familiar with treatments at all have no one to ask Is going to therapist just a choice of yours and they aren t gonna suggest you to do it ,0
Makes me feel like there s sth wrong with me ,0
The title says it all I really really hate myself for being me Starting to hate everything and the funny thing is everyone takes it as a joke Keep it up Just make me feel worse It s all I want,0
My mum was explaining to me that depression is a choice or excuse that people use She was explaining to me that she was depressed until she decided not to be and decided to play a different character This is obviously very frustrating for me to hear as someone that is trying their best every day but still not meeting their parents expectations A part of me is even wondering if maybe she s right and if I just tried harder maybe I could do better ,0
 I feel so pathetic On some days I can t even clear up after myself and it makes me feel so lazy disgusting and like I m some sort of animal I tried really hard this morning to clear up after myself but forgot to do a couple of things like put the washing machine on This wouldn t be a problem if I was on my own but I m staying with my aunt for a bit She became very angry with me because there was some sort of thing in the shower I d not thoroughly rinsed and because I d not put the washing machine on I feel so dreadful and selfish I m trying really hard but my best is never enough I just think life for everyone around me would be so much easier if I just stopped existing ,0
4 years ago I had to say goodbye to my friends from high school in year 11 going to College in the first year is not bad for me until the second year I was trying to get new friends and starting to be rude to me I can t ask their phone number because my former headteacher put me same high school class with same students in 5 years at home I had nothing at my father s house only I am can do is helping him with anything take a bin building tiny ups and carrying things I was bored with her house using a computer watch TV and video games all time I always to be alone in my room all time I am so annoyed it makes me sick I am not freefrom my parent s houses it s looked like a house arrest for my father s place I am not doing anything wrong I will be deceased myself at 30 years old if this carries on forever I loved my family so much but it s killing me in here ,0

For someone who attempted suicide twice I agree lol My life was always fucked up due on to my brain which xoklelerlllrjmkflonk Is broken Before one of my suicide attempts I literally went to the hospital after my friends begged me to go lol after waiting for 6 hours they let me see a councillor for 5 minutes and sent me home And when I self medicate It helps but I m told it s not the right way ,0

Nobody cares about me Everyone treats me like a nuicense I dont wanna live in this world with such terrible things I m not sure if theres an afterlife but I d rather jsut end it than see it through just to be treated like shit Idk why I was put in a world full of such terrible things because they just ruin it I think if i was gone it would just be better for everyone This world is just not good to me and idk what I did to deserve it I know this post is super edgy and whatever but this is really how I feel To me the reality is just theres nothing TO live for It s just about how you wanna live your life And since theres nothing to mine I dont wanna live it Thanks for reading and goodbye,0

Maybe they wasted their youth on careers and late nights working and now have teenagers who give them trouble Who s to say There s no right way of doing life 7 billion different ways to do it I have friends who are older than me and much younger It depends on the person Perhaps the people your age feel like they miss having good colleagues and friends of different ages It s a good thing Mixing up life,0
i m so hyper aware that all my thoughts are unjustified and untrue but I just can t shake the constant feelings of thinking everyone is against me or that I have nobody that truly cares I think that I push people away because i m so scared of any kind of rejection or getting hurt I m just always looking for acceptance from others I don t remember the last time I was truly happy I m just constantly lying to myself and others I m a complete fake and I don t know how to deal with it anymore Why does my brain even though I know it s wrong convince me that I m better off alone better off not here even and I can t do anything to change it I want so much from my life and set the bar so high for myself but I can t seem to achieve anything because I fall down at the first hurdle Idek why I m writing this just so confused ,0

Nostalgia Nostalgia is an interesting thing Before when I was just a little younger I could look back on things with great fondness regardless of the traumas and horrors I lived through I was happy and I knew it Even if things weren t perfect they were good Now I m just a little bit older and just a little bit wiser Or stupider It depends on your point of view really I m not happy I haven t had a genuine laugh in years I m only 18 I shouldn t be feeling this way I don t believe life is worth continuing anymore I ve become even more delusional to the point where I now strongly believe that if I successfully commit suicide I ll get a chance to restart The only thing that I m living for at the moment is my cat but we re so deeply connected that I think she would forgive me for leaving ,0
Someone I live with showed me where they keep their prescribed medication and I wish they hadn t I feel so stupid even considering it but I ve struggled with staying away from stuff like that in the past I want to pour it out but I m sure they d notice The fucked up thing is it s the same medication someone I cared about used to k1ll themselves ,0

I don t know what keeps me goingI ve had one semi successful suicide attempt this year that resulted in an overdose and coma along with at least 3 or 4 other attempts where I have backed out last minute My last attempt for example I put a hose from the exhaust of my car into the window and taped it sealed and ran the car for long enough that I started feeling it but before I passed out I got out of the car I don t know why but I know that if I was drunk I would ve gone through with it One of these times I will and I m just posting this because if I die at least someone read something I wanted to say ,0
And then I get told that my life s great and people have it worse and it just makes me feel even worse for not appreciating it I m just stuck in the shit and I ve had so many chances to just reach for a knife pop pills whatever My first real attempt was a week ago today literally around this time too and I honestly wish it did the job and now I m stuck with this level of awkwardness around the house with everyone knowing what I did and how embarrassed I am that I m the family lost cause and it just builds up the anger inside of me I m a really angry person in general and I hate myself I don t cry a lot anymore and I used to I don t know what s happened to me but I don t like myself,0

Will all this kill me I m 160 pounds  ,0
I think I get it It makes sense since I ve helped people through difficult situations through private chats and it can be extremely distressing when the person you re trying to help is suicidal I m not a trained mental health professional and yet I ve already dealt with enough of that stuff for one lifetime Unfortunately I have a tendency to play the savior for other people whilst neglecting my own issues ,0

I don t want helpThe thing is deep down I don t want to change I don t want to let go Sure I wish my life would get better Sure I wish everybody would love me but nothing will change because I will hold onto these thoughts and feelings forever Suicidal ideation is my crutch Mental health and alcoholism are my diseases Actually I have a spiritual disease And I ve done all I can But I ll keep it with me forever and I ve accepted that Sometimes when I m on vacation or doing something really fun and I ask myself Hey man this is great do you still wanna die I always answer yes I know it won t ever change But I ve accepted it ,0
I m going to do it soon I swear I cannot do this anymore Being a mother has been the hardest thing I ve had to do That sweet baby has kept me going this long but I can t do this anymore ,0

I ve had invasive thoughts almost my entire life Definitely as far back as I can accurately remember But I go through phases Sometimes they re intense someone s they re fleeting Lately they ve been intense Some have been extended daydreams I lose myself in These aren t simply about hurting myself They re extended fantasies about planning out a more permanent solution I don t understand why I have them so frequently or if they re signs of something worse I have been more depressed of late and recently engaged in self harm about two weeks ago or so I don t even know why I m actually posting this But I don t really have anywhere anyone to talk to about it Anyone have any thoughts ,0
i m at the point where i just want to end my life i never mattered to anyone i cared about ,0
human beings are horribleI m so depressed I can t have a nice conversation here With anyone About anything I keep coming to this website because I don t know where else to find people who have the answers that I am looking for and reddit makes it so easy with all of the extremely categorized subs but people are so shitty and mean about whatever they can possibly find God forbid you quote something improperly or don t source everything that you say or worse make some kind of grammatical error that you failed to catch on the first pass It s to the point where even bots are talking shit to me and I m just lonely I don t or can t trust anyone Everyone is so judgmental and shitty I don t feel like I should be wrong for wanting to assume that everyone is a well intentioned adult I don t understand what it is that makes the internet as a whole absolutely fucking despise me ,0
I think the shampoo and conditioner finally finished at the same time I might nearly write out several drafts of my letter to several different people Some in different tones then others I don t care what anyone says anymore I ll write one for my sister My pups My cat My dad my mother My siblings My poor baby sister I always prayed and wished in life I could be strong for her I don t think I m gonna make it ,0
DAE feel like they ve gone past their prime Like my life is a TV show and I m on the sixth season and everyone would say Yeah they ve ran out of material ,0
I want to stop existing but everyone considers this unfair and reminds me how good and easy I have it compared to so many This often feels like the problem I rarely have to scrap or fight for things I want and it has left this empty pointless feeling of a void to existence I get how this sounds but I have no drive left I feel as if I m getting worse every day and don t think I m going to make it through the year I m sorry I just needed to get this off my chest,0
Not sure about anyone else but I m not definitely okay with this living and don t blame those who committed suicide,0
Living alone around the holidays sucksI m 19 and just got an apartment recently I live in a small town so there s not much to do or people to hangout with I ve never really been the type to have lots of friends anyways Probably why I m depressed as heck lol I don t have family to be around either so I m just sitting at home lonely as hell I don t even want gifts or any of that stuff just someone to be around that might actually care about me for once Life sucks,0
I have been so lucky to work at a job I love for many years I have been lucky to keep my job even though the pandemic I ve sort of got a promotion and a wonderful chance to learn new things Interacting with my co workers instantly makes me want to go home and figure out a way to stop existing They are not loudly toxic I imagine that its a normal amount of passive aggressive backstabbing and bullshit The one lady who sits next to me is nice and superficially friendly mothering sort Who makes passive aggressive comments about me to the women at the other desk while I can hear her and has been putting an anchor on the things she is supposed to be showing me I feel trapped I have only gotten a few hours of sleep I just don t want to do life anymore ,0
i m fake ,0
This is my first post I 17 M never had a lot of friends As I grew up I barely had people to talk with I m ugly and barely talk with people I had a nice friendship with her until I started developing feelings I was already burdened with so many thoughts and pain so I decided to let it out to ease myself I knew it won t turn out well It didn t I thought I was gonna cry so much In my mind I m regretting it but it feels so empty I want to cry but I feel numb I ve never felt so blank and lost I don t know what comes next I ve been suffering from depression over 2 hours but now I feel numb At the same time I m happy that she was straightforward about it She s a nice person I don t know what am I gonna do Everything is falling apart ,0
I ve been suicidal for like 5 years now I say suicidal and not suicidal because although I want to die and I regularly think about how and where I d do it I knew I never would I m not so sure now I ve had a really shit time with family at the moment Not anything particularly bad It s not nice hearing that you re a burden from your own mother though 17f btw I ve always been really close with her and she s probably one of the only people who have actively kept me alive and the only person I can really speak to and it feels like everything around me is shattered into a million pieces I feel so unstable and honestly I feel like I m gonna get in one of those mind frames and I m scared I won t be able to stop it I m currently unable to get counselling etc I ve been in contact with my doctor recently and since it became a problem Any comments would be greatly appreciated I just wanna get my life together ,0

Someone help pleaseIt s just so bad there s so many things wrong Going into it all is just selfish and more of the problem I just want to drive far away and end it I can t live in this world with my personality and brain I see others I don t envy their looks I envy how they do it Sure everyone might secretly have issues even if they seem happy But at least they can seem happy Atleast they can function in society Everything I do I m too awkward or I fuck it up because I second guess my self I need help so badly but I can t find a way This probably won t get any comments but if you do read thanks for sitting through my poorly worded paragraph ,0
My depressed feeling I feel is everyday it s like I feel everybody else is at some party or like doing something I m not But In reality everybody is doing the same for the most but my mind says your just sitting here doing nothing that s the type of depression I feel like I m being left out or some amazing thing that doesn t exist Often I think of my high school days why can t I get this out of my head ,0

Offing myself isn t actually my first choice what I really would like to do is stay at home forever with my dog and my boyfriend and maybe work part time online or something But I can t do that so I d really rather just be dead Living just feels like such a chore There s nothing I really want to do with my life that anyone would pay me a livable wage for and every job I ve ever had makes me cry and want to kill myself even more I can t concentrate on any task that s actually important I don t even think I ll be able to finish college because even though I m on Vyvanse it only works for 2 hours I made a counseling appointment but I doubt it will help Does anyone get what I m talking about ,0

Basically my brother has been talking about wanting to kill himself and how he hates being alive how everyone hates him and all the dark sad thoughts you could ever express out loud he has said He has been saying goodbye to all my family and blocking everyone on social media or any form of communication with him He is on antidepressants after years of denial but smokes a ton of weed so I think it s just not doing it s effect properly Every time anyone has tried to give him any support or help he just tells everyone to fuck off and tells us he hopes we die especially me I don t know what else to do Any advice on how to navigate this situation ,0

I got into an argument with my ex tonight and during the argument I completely dissociated During this time I went to the kitchen and stabbed my arm Only when I saw that the knife had gone through my hoodie had I realized the mistake I d just made I freaked the duck out right after like I ve never been as scared I got so worried I hit a vein or tore a tendon I don t know I had gone to the hospital and they treated me and I m back home and they advised I seek mental health help Which I want to follow up on Just in a lot of ways I don t feel like there s ever any coming back from all this ,0
I do That gentle warmth That trust where you don t have to live with fear and paranoia Knowing you can reach over for some physical touch and not be rejected or shamed for it Being loved tenderly and feeling protected I miss love That safe kind Not the passionate and extreme kind that burns way too bright and way too quickly I want to be held and know that he wants me That he chooses to be with me That he cares and it s not just about what I can do for him I want to know I m wanted I want to be loved and to love I have so much love to give just not to the wrong person I don t want to be lied to again I don t want to be tricked again I don t want to have my heart pummeled into the ground again I wish I could just live life alone Not want intimacy Not need anyone else But I guess I m only human after all I want to feel the warmth of someone s touch and to feel safe in someone s arms To feel that connection ,0

I m 16 I ve been struggling depression for about 3 years and have been having suicidal thoughts more oftenI m 16 I ve been struggling depression for about 3 years and suicidal thoughts have been happening more often I don t have a bad life but the sadness is oppressive and I m finding it hard to find reasons to keep going Seeing this page has actually made it worse I think seeing all the posts of people who are in their 20s saying they ve been having the same problems from when they were younger than me because I don t think I can last another ten years of this I don t feel like I can talk about it to my family or friends and feel isolated I ve been having anxiety attacks at night and can barely sleep I don t want to be posting shit like this in another ten years but I genuinely can t see myself living for that long which worries me even more I don t know what I expect from posting this I think it was more to put my feelings into words for myself but thanks for reading i guess bye ,0
Title is basically this we were together for almost 7 years which is almost a third of my life She was my first and only love and I don t want to find anyone else becaue I only ever loved her Life is hollow and meaningless now Everything I worked for for the both of us it doesn t matter any more unless I can share it with her,0
I ve never been depressed really I ve always lived my life carefree without much thought But for the past year I ve gotten thoughts of suicide Mainly because my life is so fucking bland and boring The most exiting thing that happens in my life is playing video games my life is really dumb tbh If I wasn t a minor I would have already killed myself because I want to shoot myself rather then hanging or any other method The quickest way Plus I don t have any thing to hang myself with So I most likely won t kill myself until I can get a gun Probably 18 Has anyone else felt like there life doesn t mean munch like this When I think about my future I know I will just work some crappy job because I can t go to college Thinking about what my future holds is what really makes me want to kill myself This compared to the other stories on here might sound dumb but idk if I had a gun I d already be dead tbh There s more then this but it s pretty boring and I mm kinda lazy so eh,0

When I remember my 20 s I remember 2 different selves I was doing some pretty interesting things in different places travel outdoor activities grad school in a really awesome part of the country had some good friends But I also remember being anxious and depressed a lot of the time I look back and can t figure out how I got up and went about accomplishing the things I accomplished except bg being too anxious to not take the next steps for each job or plan I had started I knew I would feel worse if I quit But at the same time the perseverance didn t seem to pay off that much at the time because I still felt pretty down and alone a lot of the time So I got some stuff done and had interesting experiences but the fog was always there The fear of feeling worse ,0

Hi Are there resources for caregivers My post was removed from relationships for being suicide related when my problem is that I have a one sided relationship with a person who wants to commit suicide For the last 2 or 3 years they have literally only called me drunk and incoherent threatening to commit suicide and verbally abusing me I don t think I can continue to support this individual if their behavior doesn t change I feel at my wits end and I don t know else to help This individual has had a very hard life but is also an alcoholic and can be extremely verbally abusive ,0

I wish I could drink myself unconscious so I don t have to experience all the emotional pain I m feeling But I can t because I am the sole caregiver for three kids Every day I dread waking up to another day of crying I have no one to turn to for emotional support I go to agency after agency that are supposed to provide help but they don t There is nothing I can do better anything ,0

I ve lurked on Reddit for years but never had the balls to sign up and post I am truly at the end of my rope and I just wanted to reach out and have someone see this There isn t anything much to say I m a scared sad person who doesn t have any further options or avenues My brain has been on fire for so long now and I just want it to stop I know I am too frightened of pain and death to actively do anything to myself but I am just going to quit On everything Thank you to the Reddit community for making me laugh keeping me informed and generally distracting me through these times ,0
thank you it was all so sudden for me too she was totally fine the other day,0
It s like my anxiety becomes too much and too overwhelming and too draining which leads to depression and just the lack of energy to be anxious anymore It s a weird constant cycle where I m either having extreme anxiety or dealing with extreme depression No matter what I do I can never win something always feels wrong and it s exhausting One of my major ways of coping is through drawing and animating but most of the time I don t even have enough motivation for that these days I don t even know where I m going with this to be honest but everything just seems hopeless ,0

I have so many intrusive thoughts all the time and my brain tries to come up with a million reasons to hate things and to think about how useless anything I wanna do is and it s horrible When I try to do something I like especially reading that s when the thoughts strike I can no longer read because the whole time I m trying to do it I can t focus on the text because I m constantly battling the thoughts The things I love are things I now associate with my bad thoughts Now whenever I do things I enjoy I end up depressed anxious and panicked I feel like I ve lost everything Everything I love has been taken away from me And it feels so out of my control ,0
I ve lost all motivationI wake up in the morning and I don t have any goals or aspirations I just play video games or watch movies to get me through the day until I start the next one I m starting my senior year of high school soon and I still don t even have a reason to live This has been a problem I have had for years but I have never felt so close to ending it all than I do right now ,0
At least then I would have a reason to cut people off At least then I could have a good reason to not speak to my family again At least I could say they were mean and cruel and I could leave But no they just Don t care They ve never cared about what I m interested in Never took the time to get interested with me Only ever bought me the presents I had to write out on a list No surprise parties No trips that considered what might be entertaining for a only child I was never considered in any of it I didn t get to help pick out a dog My friends don t care Friend They prefer watching streamers over talking with me If that streamer actually streamed more I would never see them That feels so fucking degrading So and so cancelled stream so you want to chat No I don t I m tired of being second choice But god if I don t say yes then I m literally alone So I cling on to that last string even if one day I ll be hanged by it ,0
I keep making mistakes I keep making people miserable I keep trying to improve but I always end up doing the wrong thing I ve been crying for three hours straight now and constantly thinking about my suicide attempt from 2019 It didn t matter how many Xanax I took right now I still can t sleep and I have to stay aware of how horrible a person I am and how better Id be if I was dead I can t self harm because I promised my family I wouldn t I m stuck I just don t want to be here,0
people feel sorry for methey see me as a loser old retarded I wish I could die I am 28 M piece of shit jobless,0
Turning Suicidal Ideation into Hope NAMI National Alliance on Mental IllnessI found this helpful and thought I would share it here ,0
Why should I have to live for others It s pretty convenient stating that you ll support me for the rest of your life when you re the one who s doing okey I have to be this bipolar crazy and sad for the rest of my life I m the one who can t finish a high school diploma or get a permanent full time job I m the one who has to feel shitty for the rest of my life so that you can have me in yours If I die you won t have that pressure on you to check up on me support me or even babysit me No more difficult behaviour or fights You ll feel sad for a while but you ll get over it because you ll know that I d be happier in death than in life Like wtf how am I the who is selfish when I m the one who s got to live this way You re selfish for keeping me here And I m so done with all this bs ,0
I walked away from my job in April after having regular panic attacks in my car at work to just leaving Ever since then I only focused on staying alive living day by day I did it by not thinking about tomorrow or yesterday only what I wanted to do that day nothing else It s June now and all my bills are due I tried to handle one task and had a full on panic attack crying screaming hyperventilating etc I d rather drive into a tree without a seatbelt than get another job ,0
Just stopStop telling us to go get help Go see someone Because obviously the last thing I want to do when I m already down is talk to a random stranger about my issues and problems The people who care so much about me can only tell me go see someone I m trying to talk to you and you push me off And then when I finally do commit suicide it s all the I wish they would have told me or they never said anything Bullshit And they wonder why depression is so prevalent because nobody really cares You see a therapist but at the end of the day they are there just for a check My depression lately has me noticing that nobody really gives a shit about me And what an awful surprise it would be if I was perished one day End rant ,0
I m just tired I know it s immoral I ll end up in hell I m weak minded unwilling to deal with my problems and unwilling to change myself I m selfish I m throwing away gods greatest gift I m a shameful burden upon my family I m a weakling I m just tired I m scared of their voices and I just want to be a normal teenager I just want a tight hug from someone I feel so tired If I die I won t have to hear about him call me weak minded and all the names in the book that just show how much he hates suicidal people I won t have to hear my sense of self being destroyed from the inside out by her cruel words or the pressure I won t have to hear everyone call me weak because how dare I think of killing myself I can t see myself making it past highschool I wanted to be an animator or something but I just want to sleep now I want a hug I feel so alone,0
I Peaked in CollegeThere s nothing left to look forward to now Just a lonely 9 5 job that won t pay enough for healthcare and my relationships dwindling away ,0
The whole point of this post is that there are better ways to offer solace than validating someone s suicidal intent and self hatred You re using words like free and open and trying to link those words with an environment where suicide voyeurism and incitement are tolerated Some people just need reassurance That the darkness is finally ending that it s okay to finally go into that good night You can use all the comforting language you want That doesn t change the fact that you re just dressing up suicide incitement It s okay to go into that good night is just a way of telling someone you re not welcome here In general though our moderation philosophy is to be extremely strict with the peoole who are giving support but lenient with those who are here to get it I ve never seen anyone who made a big deal out of being unfairly banned by us who wasn t also lying about the actual reasons ,0
Because that s life People have lost way more than just 4 relationships im in a pretty low spot myself The strong move on the weak get swallowed up So which are you ,0

Not sure if I can do this anymore Nothing is helping me Not meds therapy or family I ve lost all of my friends and I don t wanna keep living like this I m so unhappy that even saying that is an understatement I m not sure if I want to die or just not be me anymore If that makes sense ,0
Nobody cares about me Everyone treats me like a nuicense I dont wanna live in this world with such terrible things I m not sure if theres an afterlife but I d rather jsut end it than see it through just to be treated like shit Idk why I was put in a world full of such terrible things because they just ruin it I think if i was gone it would just be better for everyone This world is just not good to me and idk what I did to deserve it I know this post is super edgy and whatever but this is really how I feel To me the reality is just theres nothing TO live for It s just about how you wanna live your life And since theres nothing to mine I dont wanna live it Thanks for reading and goodbye,0
I turned 20 four days ago I didn t think it d affect me very much but it s made me really sad Although I ve always suffered from depression I had a great few years as a teenager particularly when I was 15 16 I watched back on my Snapchat memories from around that time and it s made me quite emotional I feel like I m kind of closing the door on that part of my life It s so difficult to accept I ll never experience life the same way as I did at 16 years old The past year of my life has gone so fast especially with lockdown and I feel like I ve missed out on so much,0
Honestly I m always making jokes on how I want to die and I always say something someone it should be over but in all honesty I don t want to die I want just not be sad There is no reason to be sad honestly but everything is just grey and meaningless I m an optimistic person and I try to look at all the good things but I m not sure why I hate it so much Why I m so sad why I want it all to end why I make jokes saying oh will someone kill me already I don t want to die I m just not sure how to live ,0

I just can tI don t know what to do anymore I ve lost everything no matter how hard I work and try its not enough,0
Is my life valuable If so why Everyone around me keeps telling me I shouldn t kill myself because my life is valuable but I don t understand what that means Why is my life valuable No one seems to know beyond their own selfish reasons for wanting me to stay alive It certainly doesn t feel valuable to me and isn t my assessment the only one that really matters after all I m the one that has to live it I just don t understand the logic of telling someone their life is valuable when the only ostensible value said life has is that that person s friends and family can hit them up when THEY feel like it without actually doing anything to try and improve that person s quality of life ,0
For a few weeks I was really doing better Now I feel like I am falling into another spiral of exhaustion and dysfunction Yesterday I was so dead at 2pm in the afternoon I had quart of cola just to be able to safely drive a car I hate being this dead ,0

I am sitting here in bed and my gut is wrenching thinking about how alone I am I really think I have an issue developing personal relationships and it creates a constant cycle of loneliness Maybe I am not meant for that and biologically I was built to live and fend for myself The issue is that I live in a society where everyone s love lives are blasted on social media and television I am jealous of people that have issues with their spouses because at least they have had the capacity to develop a relationship in the first place I don t necessarily want to die but I refuse to live the rest of my life like this There just doesn t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel I am on a wheel and I know that nothing will ever change because it never has I know I am the problem and I won t ever be able to fix that I am not writing this because I am suicidal I m more apathetic towards life and there isn t anything to look towards ,0
I m in a really rough state of mind right now I could use some grounding I feel the weight of the emptiness from where my parent should have put love and understanding It s such a vague thing But What can I say to myself I m so distant from love How do I get closer if it feels so foreign I could use some advice How do we start accepting love from other people Thanks,0
Everyone in the place is just incredibly condescending ,0
I ve had suicidal thoughts for as long as I could remember I remember writing a suicide note when I was like 6 and trying to run away I m almost 23 now and they just keep getting worse For a while I was really only hanging on because I felt too guilty about what my family would go through but now I m only hanging on for my cat She was abused and mistreated by her previous owners and it took her over a year to warm up to me I can t just leave her without someone that understands her the way I do Sometimes I cry when I think her passing I don t think I ll be able to handle it but for now she s my rock Sorry if this is incoherent I m sad and not having a good time,0
Does anybody know any good distractions I ve given up trying to get better and just want to be distracted from suicidal thoughts anything that will make my brain focus on something else would be great ,0

I can t tell you how nice it feels to know that I m not the only one who thinks this way Everyday I m made fun of and called a wierdo for having a view that doesn t fit in with what the society thinks When my family tries to help me they say that this is because I m being lazy and finding excuses to get out of doing things And when someone keeps saying something to you so often I guess you start to believe it at some point But honestly I can t get myself to do anything at all I don t know if I need help and I don t know how to get it rn Thank you if you ve read this far Take care all of you ,0

 I feel like this subreddit may be a bit of an exception to the 1 9 part If creation is making posts and starting discussion and contributing is replying to posts then I think we have as much or even more creation as contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get I think that part of it is that a lot of posts are actually kind of comments rather than creations A surprising number of posts here are title only and we re not super happy about that We would like to see people who ve reached out for support and given the community meaningful information to respond to get more quality responses and we re working on some things to help with that ,0
I m doing it You probably saw me in this sub a few days ago I finally managed to fix my handgun Now i m commiting suicide because of my inceldom It s over and i don t care about it I will die a virgin how pathetic right because i didn t had the courage to hire a sex worker I hope my parents suffer a lot because they denied me in my whole life There s nothing that will change my mind I m hoping that humanity suffers a lot in this new year Goodbye people ,0

I ve spent the last 3 to 4 years in therapy and it has done nothing to help me I finally went to the doctor about a few issues and spoke on depression anxiety She gave me the typical screening and I of course failed the exam She asked me how I felt and also said that I do have panic attacks which felt so freeing to know what I was feeling wasn t all in my head I knew I had depression and anxiety but the heart palpitations really are annoying and make me nervous as they go on I m still really nervous about it has anyone had similar problems with medicine ,0

I ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm for years but the past week or so has been the most I ve ever struggled with my depression Every night I find myself sitting by the medicine cabinet and I just want to take another attempt And on top of that every night I keep cutting and hurting myself I feel like I ve lost control of myself Yesterday I told my mom that I didn t feel safe and I wanted to get help but she said that I don t need help I told her about how badly I was struggling and she told me that I just wanted to go to the mental hospital so that I didn t have to go back to school All she s offering me are multivitamins She won t let me go on anti depressants or see a therapist And I can t take myself to the hospital because I m underage I need her permission to everything and she won t let me I m so close to just ending it because I can t keep myself safe ,0
Sorry for the double post Well It is another 201 for me Voluntary commitment I have to either sign myself in or I get 302ed They saw my face and the decision was made for me I knew it was coming and I will be probably going back down to the same hospital as before I am too numb to cry I will miss my son s 5th birthday Hopefully I will be able to call them I am scared This REALLY sucks LG ,0
Before you ever feel suicidal You feel that people who take their life are the most selfish people in the world Then when you truly feel that the world would be so much better without you in it you realize that it isn t selfish Your mind is that messed up you truly believe killing yourself would be the best thing for everyone ,0
But I think I m close to my breaking point 2 out of my 3 businesses closed because of the pandemic The only surviving business hasn t had income for the last year I ve depleted all my savings My mom and siblings are helping me financially Credit card is nearly maxed out Im trying to sell my car and I ve been on the job hunt as well since March Second baby on the way More expenses coming Pregnant partner is bat crazy and wants to leave She s unsupportive too and demands so many things Sometimes I want to leave the relationship too for my sanity but I m not selfish enough to do that to my 2 year old kid and unborn baby I m not the type to hurt myself but I m all bottled up inside and feeling like I m about to explode ,0

What does it matter if I choose euthanasia I m 25 and nothing crushes my soul more than the thought of aging The other day I went for a walk and men all over kept making fools of themselves trying to make it known that they think I m beautiful It s stupid as shit But I think about how that will only last until I m 40 or 50 and then I will be wrinkly and repulsive I can t identify myself as somebody that age I feel better facing my life when I think that 49 will be my last full year Either on my 50th birthday or in the middle of that year I ll be 110 ready to peacefully go to the physical negation zone so my spirit never has to be mudded with the inclusion of decay years I will be happier for having accepted I am halfway through my lifespan It s good ,0

I can t keep fighting on your always told your not alone but you are no one truly knows or understands what your life is like gp or other doctors don t truly believe most people and that just discourages me to bother getting happy it will only be like last time we only live for so long but when you live a life you can t enjoy can t be happy in all of it feels meaningless,0
Anyone else feel incredibly disconnected A lot of the time I barely fee human I look at people and the way they interact and it s just so foreign to me I don t know I just feel completely disconnected from everything even myself to the point where I don t think I was even meant to be alive It s surreal really and I m not sure how I got to this point and I don t think I can ever get back to any sense of normalcy ,0
I built a wall around my emotions I am extremely numb to a lot of things At the end of the day I think I am the only one who can hurt myself I am better at hiding whats wrong with me now and people in turn think I m an asshole for being such a wall Its pretty dark behind this wall ,0

Why can t I just bone a cute cosplayer Why do I have to watch myself grow older when my taste in women won t catch up Each moment I go without the embrace I grow more fearful Fearful that I ll be a creep Fearful that I ll get rejected Fearful that I ll accidentally hit on someone underage and go to jail Can I at least be cured of the fear of failure Can I at least figure out how to get a hookup at Fanime ,0
So I ve had suicidal ideation come and go for the past few years it can be pretty scary but I manage to pull through I talked to a few of my friends about it recently none of them have any diagnosed mental health problem yet they admit that from time to time they have suicidal thoughts so my question is what percent of people with suicidal ideation actually commit suicide ,0

For context I m 19 years old and I m starting my second year at a community college in August I want to take a semester off due to an all time low in motivation I d rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job seeing a therapist working out really just getting better The problem with telling them I don t want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and I d rather not lie to them They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing And I know it s not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I can t help it I was hoping to get some advice on the matter because if I don t make up my mind soon I ll lose the opportunity to enroll in class if things don t go play out how I think they might ,0
I ve been horribly depressed recently because of stress but for the first time in ages I actually worked out It was only about 15 minutes and very basic exercises but I did it It s okay I didn t do a lot and it would ve been okay if I has just gotten up but for me this was a baby step I m proud of,0

I am in a relationship with the love of my life Shes amazing loving and overall the best She suffers from depression for a few years I have no real experience with depression but i know i cant heal it for her and that she has no control over it However i dont love her less for that I just want to be there for her and comfort her the best i can Sadly therapy is not available for her at the moment So im trying to gather as much information as i can to be there for her I know everyone has a different experience with depression and everyone needs different things when they are down However i would like to ask you to share your experience what helps you and what you like other people or specifically your partner to do to be helpful Thanks a lot ,0
I ve made a list of the pros and cons of me ending my life and the cons heavily outweigh the pros However I m having an extremely difficult time today I ve been crying all day and I just feel so tired of everything I know that I can t give up now but the idea is so tempting I m contemplating calling the suicide hotline but I m not even sure what I would say I ve struggled with mental health my entire life But honestly I don t get these suicidal thoughts and temptations that much So when I do it feels like a very good idea Which makes me very worried I m not sure what I m asking for I guess to everyone reading this this stuff is so hard I hope we all end up okay I don t know what else to say I hope we all find a reason to not do it ,0

So suicide has become one option against constant pain But am I the only one who is so torn between these options If I choose to live it ll be constant fight mental and physical pain and no guarantees that it would ever get even on the good side The other path is peaceful and demands nothing But tomorrow I have to know which one to choose because I will not live my final moments struggling I will sell whatever I have eat whatever I want to etc The other path demands military like discipline for years to even get even ,0

A question about therapy and suicidal thoughtsI have suicidal thoughts regularly the extent is irrelevant but I m very wary of getting therapy and being honest about what I think feel amp x200B If the therapist were to intervene by having me committed I m afraid that that would just make problems worse once I eventually got out Payment missed school work being outed as suicidal to my family friends etc I guarantee I would still feel the same afterwards probably even worse amp x200B It it possible to get help and be fully honest about the full extent of my feelings without fearing repercussions amp x200B If I can t feel safe enough to fully confide why the hell should I bother ,0

Dying without experiencing loveI m talking about romantic love I ve never been in a relationship although nothing will matter when I m dead it still makes me sad knowing I never got to experience that kind of love ,0
You can t break facts My life is gonna be a mess and I see it I m afraid of it Combined with all the other things my life fucked Socially my personality is weird The chance of getting ignored is high I m afraid of it I really hate it when I indicate that I m suicidal and everyone takes it as a joke or just ignores it I tried again and again Nah Cut people off and no active social interaction at all It s much better than saying I m not okay and getting ignored I don t have any feelings All are gone I can t even feel that I m alive Self harm is the way to feel something I have no reason to keep going and I just want to die as soon I can My existence is worthless ,0
thank god,0

I m not even sad at the idea of dying I m excited Every second for me is painful to sit through but there are still some things I want to try in life I ve been sleeping most of the day and waking up at night and once I wake up after a long sleep I cannot go back to sleep for like 6 hours Everything that entertains me somehow only last for a little bit of time and I am so tired of having a consciouness Time seems so slow last week seems like it was ages ago and I m inpatient I set myself to die when I m about 40 because I don t want to live too long For the first time in a couple of years I have an actual friend but I fear she might stop talking to me because I talk about the same shit over and over again and use her as a therapist but I just can t help myself nothing exciting ever happens in my life ,0
Single 33M I moved in with my parents a few months ago I left LA due to the fact that rent was high and all of my work had become remote due to the pandemic so I saw an opportunity to save a lot of money However following a breakup I ve been pretty depressed However I can t help but wonder if some of this depression is due to living at home My parents aren t overbearing and they ve been very accomodating but I m starting to wonder if living with them is not good for me mentally I ve always valued my independence and liked living in bigger cities where I m surrounded by people like me Before moving home the primary problem was anxiety and panic Now the primary problem is deep depression Can anybody relate ,0
But if you ever voice sentiments like these in America people just call you lazy and entitled while they are surrounded by evidence of the system s failings   North Korea should be envious of our propaganda machine ,0

I feel lower than I ever have after being on the top of the world just a couple weeks ago Everything came crashing down What s the point of anything good It doesn t and can t last I can t find the motivation to do anything not even the smallest things seem worth it All I ve done is lay in bed and be pathetic Every thought in my brain is self degrading and negative and it doesn t stop I want my happiness back ,0
I keep calling crisis lines and I still don t feel better I m trying so hard but I just can t kick this feeling of wanting to die I am seriously thinking about suicide and I can t stop thinking about it I am not considered to be cool but that s not the most of my problems I am treated with such disrespect by people I care about and nobody takes my feelings in to account I am always written off as being too sensitive and I am just dismissed Everyone wants to know what s wrong nobody wants to help Everyone just wants to go on and live their lives and leave me behind unless they want something I am so pathetic that I give them what they want just so they ll pay attention to me for that little bit I am so pathetic and when I try to stand up for myself and be strong people tell me I m being bitchy I m so sick of dealing with this on a daily basis I just want to end it I don t know why I m typing this I guess I just want to get it off my chest ,0
The pain never ends I keep thinking that it can t get worse Nothing can hurt me as much as what I ve already felt But it does get worse I hate life There is nothing good here for me I wish I wasn t scared to die ,0

I m not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I don t think it s something you can say without coming across like that so whatever But I don t know I just want to do heroin really badly right now I guess I m just sick of feeling so shitty and I m sick of nothing working to make it better All the medications I ve been on have done sweet fuck all and I ve been through dozens at this point Therapy hasn t helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time I feel like I don t belong in the world at all and yet I m forced to exist in it So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin ,0
i can t see any other option at this point i don t see a future for myself anymore ,0

I told my fianc this morning about how I have been feeling for the last few months and how unbearable it is now He was diagnosed bipolar in his early 20 s so he has had his own issues with mental health and knows how to approach stuff like this and he is being so supportive I am really scared though he wants to check me into an inpatient program and I have never done anything like this I am only 21 and I have been open with my parents about suicidal thoughts in my teenage years when I still lived with them and they never cared or basically told me I was fine bc I had a good life I fully went into an anxiety attack on my way to work and had to pull over for a bit I feel like I ve let him down and like I ve let my job down I don t know what to do ,0

Yeah we re basically being farmed by the top few wealth hoarders It s extremely difficult to cope with and it s impossible to believe in the system with this knowledge Most people are either unaware of this or so thoroughly subservient that they have no problem with it so it s pretty much impossible to connect with the average person on anything beyond a surface level Capitalism has destroyed the human experience and I m beginning to think that my depression might not even be pathological I m just reacting correctly to a post apocalypse of the human spirit We need a cultural awakening Maybe one day this world will be worth inhabiting but I don t think it s coming in our lifetimes We have to fight for it though ,0
I m unsubscribing I ve decided not to do it I m nowhere near being OK but I ll try to be strong I need to be My heart is still broken but I don t want the same for my daughter I am a mother and I can t just leave her behind I hope you guys find your peace If anybody would like to talk I m here We re all hurting but it doesn t mean that it s over For most people like me the ones that are alone please be strong We don t know what the future holds so let s keep hoping for the best ,0

Does anybody here wake up and instead of feeling super groggy and not wanting to get up you instead feel extreme stress extreme despair extreme nervous energy Like you HAVE to get up and do SOMETHING but you don t know what that something is You are hit with a wave of extreme low mood and extreme anxiousness at the same time To me this is the most maddening of a depressive state ,0
Due to something that has happened between us we re not friends anymore I won t go into any details but he hurt me on levels that I didn t think were possible I trusted him He knew all of my secrets my strengths and weaknesses my past aspirations and goals and according to him I only knew 17 of him I was always okay with that Until today We were so close I m ready to overdose on painkillers now Or stab myself with one of our kitchen knives This is the last straw I can t do this anymore The one person who I thought was my best friend hurt me so deeply that I probably won t be able to recover He knows he hurt me and he intended it He knows I m suicidal and it makes him happy I m so disgusted and hurt and tired and angry I just want to slit my throat open and die He was the last thing keeping me here And now we re done ,0

the light came half looseSo I ve been trying to psych myself up multiple times this year to hang myself and always got so close but decided to backdown I ve had problems for the last 6 7 years and it s only ever been downhill Tonight I managed to get to the point of knotting the noose around both the light and my neck I took one step off the chair and heard an unmistakable clunking noise Putting my weight back onto the chair I looked up to confirm my suspicions that the light had come half off the ceiling and would surely come full off if I took the leap amp x200B I m a very small guy and simply rolled my eyes at this act of either divine intervention or pure bad luck I haven t another place to privately end my life so my option which I had be deliberating for so long had just been taken from me It s hillarious that even when trying to end my pitiful life I am not allowed the chance or choice Though I didn t laugh ,0
I m working my butt off to earn but still it s not enough Problems shitting with me every now and then Been hustling like a bee Resting is a luxury I m tired I just want to rest forever ,0

I hear you Your trying and going and that s really good that s a really important step I know this is so God awful and even the big things feel hard It s a crushing weight Don t feel as though your not achieving anything profound this world we re living in this life we share it s so much harsher than the normal world where a toothbrush can weight a tone when the outside might be filled with abject monsters Your doing good Progress ramps up but I know at the start it may seem like nothing I know you have the strength to persist your already doing so much and you should be proud of yourself having lived this most all my life I am certainly proud of your strength and commitment I see how hard things actually are ,0
I have to do so many difficult things to fix my life and it s gonna a really long time The other solution is to kill myself just that one thing which may take just a few minutes I wish suicide was as easy as I think it is I can t get my mind and body to work to fix myself I just can t I have already decided that suicide is only the way and no one can prove me otherwise Even if they can I will just ignore them I just want to disappear from this world ,0
Crying crying crying Crying and more crying,0

I feel like If I don t get into a good school that might be itI have been very not well the past 5 or 6 years constantly on and off this sub on and off meds and through some of the hardest nights of my life especially within the past 2 years I have grad school admissions coming up in the next semester I will get back the decisions sometime next spring and honestly I don t know if I can keep going if those don t go as planned I have 3 relatable majors from a good public school good research experience I think some good letters of recomendation but my grades leave something to be desired and thats the one thing I can t change My grades aren t awful nothing below a B but not many A s in there I tried my best too which in my mind makes things worse I have lost all direction in my life over the past 4 or 5 years the only thing keeping me grounded and turning was school and I have no idea what I will do if I don t have that after my undergraduate is done,0

Hello everyone I m new to this group I m 19 in UK and I ve been dealing with depression alot I was first diagnosed with OCD Anxiety and depression a few years ago And I ve recently just come out of an 8 month relationship I use to lean on her a lot for support for my mental health and now she s gone I m kinda stuck I don t really have anyone to talk to through out my day I have my mum she s my best friend but I d like to have someone I can make friends with and i can just make general conversation with My life s just a constant up and down spiral If anyone has any advice for me please let me know And go easy on me lol Any advice to get over a break up too would be appreciated Thanks very much ,0
Ok so this is interesting I fully understand both sides of the argument here If u wake up in the morning and tell yourself i am so depressed or i hate my life i dont want to get out of bed so on and so forth U literally are making yourself depressed Now when i say that i dont want to invcalidate anyones emotions or depression But it is a well known fact that the mind ego works in a way where it defines itself by certain attributes it believes about itself himself herself So if being depressed is part of your identity u will unconciously want to hold on to that identity by repeatedly telling yourself that u are indeed depressed And so if u would decide to from now on ONLY think empowering things about yourself u could possibly slowly get better Not necessarily though Its not always that cut and dry ,0
I really need someone to talk toi m having a really hard time with life right now i m going through one of the hardest break ups ever and i know it s silly to want to commit suicide over a relationship but i ve never felt a pain so crushing and i want it to stop ,0
In German we have a word for what you are having Weltschmerz it means something like world weariness The question I d like to ask y all is if someone told you that you could change the system and showed you a coherent way how to get there Would you be willing to work for it or would you rather just be depressed ,0
I m sick and tired of people just leaving me in the dust I try so hard to be the best person I can but it s never good enough for anyone I have no point in being here because I m not good enough for anyone or anytbing I need to kill myself so badly but I can t work up the courage to go thru with it I m going to buy a glock and hopefully it will be easier to just pull a trigger then hangibg yourself,0
I m sorry if I ever hurt anyone I never meant to hurt anyone I was going through a lot I m trying to be better I m trying to be my best for others I want to see everyone in my life happy,0
I m beginning to ask myself why me Like why is my life like this and especially for the past 4 years What have I done to deserve it all Between mental health and physical health I have not ever been able to catch a break Nothing is ever going good it seems I am always constantly stressed or destroyed Fought a battle with depressed and suicidal ideation for 2 years and right after I overcame that I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer After it was taken care of last year I am now diagnosed with heart complications and have to have open heart surgery About a week ago I got into a car accident and a few days ago I got into another My girlfriends car is totaled and so is mine Today she told me she s done My 22 years of living has been living hell It makes me think why was I put onto this earth It seems the universe just keeps trying to kill me Whether it s from myself my health issues or these freak accidents I don t really know what I have to live for,0
How do I kill myself in a country with no guns I have access to a high building but im afraid it might go wrong If you are going to try to talk me out of it please just leave one answer to the question above at least your opinion on it My life isn t really that hard or anything so nobody has to worry Im just your average person that can t handle the pressure because im a loser,0

It s timeI ve put off killing myself for 8 years and I m at the point where if I don t die things will get worse I don t feel angry sad or hurt I just know that what I say what I do and who I am is completely void of any worth and that to be cost effective I should die ASAP That s why tonight I plan on going to a restroom at a park in my town with gasoline and I will self immolate Note that I m not doing this for a political or religious reason but simply because the best thing to do is kill myself Also I know I upranked this post it was an accident ,0
 Had to put a title here but dont know what to say Sometimes i just dont feel it worth for living anymore Te thoughts of that nobody would remeber me or would care about me if i would die just makes it worse When i have these thoughts im also just thinking about dissapearing starting a new life in a country far away were nobody knows what kind of shit i am what lies have been told where i can find people to care for and people who care for me Its just those days where i havent even said a word to anyone and where i realise how lonely im actually are ,0

At least then I would have a reason to cut people off At least then I could have a good reason to not speak to my family again At least I could say they were mean and cruel and I could leave But no they just Don t care They ve never cared about what I m interested in Never took the time to get interested with me Only ever bought me the presents I had to write out on a list No surprise parties No trips that considered what might be entertaining for a only child I was never considered in any of it I didn t get to help pick out a dog My friends don t care Friend They prefer watching streamers over talking with me If that streamer actually streamed more I would never see them That feels so fucking degrading So and so cancelled stream so you want to chat No I don t I m tired of being second choice But god if I don t say yes then I m literally alone So I cling on to that last string even if one day I ll be hanged by it ,0
Lost ImageI think I saw it when browsing imgur but it was a few years ago or longer I think it was a Tumblr post They spoke of how if you wanted to commit suicide you should go do something meaningful in dangerous places like volunteering in war torn places Or go do the things you were too afraid to do like sky diving The worst that could happen is you die the best is that you discover a reason to live I found it very helpful even though I can t remember it very well anymore If someone has it saved or can do a better Google search than me could you post it Maybe someone else will find it helpful I know it can t help everyone but maybe it can help just one more person ,0
l There should be another way for ppl to come to this world No one deserves to come to this world without their previous consent So what should I do Like I was sent to be born in a poor family I grew up surrounded by poverty careless parents and lack of opportunities So what do I do in a situation like that I was a difficult kid a difficult teen and ofc now I am a difficult adult I don t see any expectation of improvement I don t see myself rich full of money I don t see myself being happy So how am I supposed to live a life full of sorrows poverty and failures This is not what I want for me I wish I was born in a rich family of successful businesspeople or celebrities and well life gave me two poor narcissistic teens instead Nice ,0
Regression imminent hope is lost A couple of weeks ago I started to feel depressed This wouldn t be anything out of the ordinary if it wasn t for the suicidal feelings along with the depression I was extremely suicidal at one point I wanted nothing more than to end my wretched existence I received help and treatment and with time got back on track Now I feel like I ve gone back to square one All of my self destructive habits are back in full force and I m not sure how long it ll be before I start attempting suicide again I would seek treatment but due to time and money constraints I can not My academic progress is essentially halted and I have no desire to keep trying I ve been here before during my first battle with depression and I received a lot of support I appreciate any help I can get now Thank you ,0
I want to sleep foreverEverything feels so heavy and so full of pain I have been trying to make the sadness go away for so many years I feel like my entire life has been searching for reasons to live and waiting for things to get better but each year seems to bring more hurt I am very alone There is no one I am close to everyone seems to hurt me I had one person I trusted and they re no longer my friend The pain from losing that friendship is very raw and it s pushing me over the edge When I m asleep the pain goes away I don t want to be sad anymore I don t want anyone to hurt me anymore I have some pills and I want to just take them get into bed and let all the pain go ,0

 That s fucking pathetic Today earlier I received a message from an entitled activist She told me that she d help me with my problems and stuff but nothing could be more useless than that She just gave a shallow discourse underrating my problems and the worst part she just romanticized poverty Like wtf As I got blocked I have some things I wish her to know First beautiful words solve nothing Problems need solutions not beautiful words If the problems are financial like mine they require money If problems are regarding health they require medicines If you can t help that s ok But please just don t make things worse We already have our demons to battle Don t be another demon in ppl s lives ,0

I know the truth of this world You re all not real you re just a bunch of literal dolls You all have plastic skin and I know everything isn t real as the plants are made of plastic You re all toys and I m the only human I m so lonely living like this I know y all will probably answer or not because the child wants to play They are playing a game They are using all their dolls but not me because I m real I m not a toy and that s lonely I need to kill myself partly because of the loneliness of being the only human I need to die I m tired of being apart of some child s imagination ,0
I want to disappearI did something that has doomed me My anxiety and depression are the only thing left of me ,0
Just let me kill myself alr I even procrastinate killing myself when I know its my only way I need a fast and non painful way which also doesn t include the risk of it failing and making me worse ,0
I think he s goneThough we haven t known each other long I feel like we ve been friends forever We were helping each other We understood each other He was a little more worse off but we both struggle with suicidal tendencies and mental disorders I m never going to find someone like him again I feel so sick so empty I don t know what to do anymore ,0
I d say start with really looking inward when you feel like this Ask yourself what am I feeling Anger boredom sadness Try to identify which part of the routine really gives you this feeling I had a super silly example this week I ve been walking the dogs every day the dogs aren t mine but i offered since no one else would and they would every day run to a pile of rotten garbage and I d have to shampoo them all the time By myself it s too tough to watch 3 dogs and yesterday my sister said it may be better if they take them Honestly i woke up super well today just because I didn t have to walk the dogs and i was able to just plan my day my way Not saying i suddenly did everything well but my day began a lot better If you can see if there are annoying things in your routine you could eliminate Maybe talk to a professional too The smallest things make the largest difference Wish you the best ,0
one of my latest ruminations is that nobody could ever hate me as much as i hate myself what does this do for me absolutely nothing but it feels like an absolute truth ,0

My dad hurt me About a month ago I confessed to him that all I could think about was killing myself and that I need to find help He flew into a rage and told me that I d been given every chance to succeed that he was gonna take away my phone because further isolation always makes things better yay that if I just listened to his advice I wouldn t be going through this The worst thing though was that he told me to just do it He calmed down and apologized afterwards but I cannot trust him with this anymore I will never forget him telling me to kill myself even as he and the rest of my family were a major reason for me not doing it So now I m just crying myself to sleep or not sleeping at all cause I don t know how to get help and I m still thinking about it a lot ,0

Sorry the title pretty much says it all I finally fell asleep at about 1am because I was absolutely exhausted but I had this really morbid nightmare and woke up at 2 50 It was graphic as hell and really disturbing I was too scared to fall asleep again so now I m shattered The worst part was waking up in a cold sweat and desperately longing for my ex I just wanted to cling to them and sob I was terrified and they re the first place my mind went to I don t think they ll ever understand how much they meant to me and how willing I was to stick around when things got hard I just wanted them I think this might have pushed me a little further so Idk if I m gonna survive the week at this rate I don t see a point in living ,0

From what i read manny soldiers killed themselves because they didn t like the life they were living and the generals and leaders didn t like that so they used religion as a weapon to keep people from killing themselves which is fcked ul I looked it up but i hate how they used that instead of trying to make things better for the people ,0

I am exhausted burned out and have zero motivation to work on anything It happens after any happy event that takes place because i see everyone enjoying and i am working stressed out The worst of all is that i know i cant take break even after the event is over and somehow i compose myself and keep going and its draining my every last bit of cell inside me I used to love what i do but this burnout and lack of break is killing me Now i dont want to do anything and the single thing in my mind is that perhaps one day i will have a good vacation without worrying about anything but it seems impossible now I just wish i regain the energy and charisma in doing what i am passionate about because this rough patch is killing me,0
 obvious tw for self harm talk didnt really know where to put this so sorry if this doesnt belong on the sub but lately like within the week i ve been getting self harm urges its my first time ever experiencing this and i have no idea why my depression isnt at its worst like rn im mostly numb actually but for some reason i just got this urge to try cutting my wrist the other day and it hasn t really left me it gets esp bad whenever im in the bathroom or kitchen i m just thinking abt all the tools i can use and ive come so close to trying i feel kinda self conscious like i know it s not this way but in my head this is problems for teenagers or like middle schoolers i feel too old to be doing it for the first time if that makes any sense but idk im a lil scared i might start anyways idk where im really going with this i guess im just more so confused as to why i suddenly got this urge outta nowhere ,0
I might not be alive in the morning but there s something more concerningI m thinking very seriously about attempting to kill myself again but I don t feel like it s really me doing the thinking about it There s things coming into my head and I can t stop them from nagging at me constantly like a force pushing me to do things that are completely unreasonable like intrusive thoughts but stronger and darker It s encouragement that I don t want and can t ignore It s not right I didn t put them there it s like they aren t supposed to be there This scares the hell out of me but it sounds a bit like schizophrenia and I don t know if I could live with that I m scared to go back to the hospital I m going to go drink heavily since that s all that really helps me at the moment PS sorry if this isn t okay to post here and for the terrible writing,0

I just completely broke down screaming crying shouting negative banter I really think this session could ve gone well if I controlled myself and analyzed my thoughts It s been so tough these past days and I just couldn t take it anymore My therapist was left speechless and couldn t put a word in It s ok to have a shoulder to cry on but it s depressing knowing there s only so much they can do but listen I just want things to be better but so much is going wrong I m so lost I m so confused I m starting to have homicidal thoughts for the first time in my life I m so angry I ve held in my anger and pain all my life and it s finally out This is my last straw I m on edge all the time I just don t know what to do anymore ,0

I think suicide is the best option for meI know that many of you will try to talk me out of doing this But I feel as if living will only cause me more and more pain each and every day of my life I ve tried everything from counselling to pills to try and help but nothing does absolutely nothing I always got told don t do it things will get better but it never has gotten better I ve written my suicide note and i broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years I got with her when I was 12 to spare her less pain I m failing school I struggle a lot in school with things most people find basic and easy so i won t have a good job and I won t have a high salary so I just think what s the point in being in school for longer to end up in a shitty job I m grateful for everything I ve been given and for the people who have been in my life but I m sorry I can t live any longer like this waking up everyday questioning my life and crying myself to sleep I just can t ,0
I m not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I don t think it s something you can say without coming across like that so whatever But I don t know I just want to do heroin really badly right now I guess I m just sick of feeling so shitty and I m sick of nothing working to make it better All the medications I ve been on have done sweet fuck all and I ve been through dozens at this point Therapy hasn t helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time I feel like I don t belong in the world at all and yet I m forced to exist in it So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin ,0
So I m in a very bad place since Idk how much time I don t have much money as I don t even work anymore but I really needed help and wanted to get help so I payed for a private psychologist It s been 10 sessions now and they sended an email to my psychiatrist that I ve got from the public system after trying to die saying that they transfert my case to her It took 10 sessions and 1500 from me for that and all that time that I thought I was getting help wasted This money was precious money give me a lot of anxiety And it s all wasted,0
I don t really see the point in being alive my only reason is my friends who barely like me I d be better if i just died life is just happiness followed by pain forever and ever death is a complete mystery for all i know it could be 20x better than life maybe I d just be nothing which wouldn t be all that bad maybe I d live another life free of my pressure mum s bs expectations and my disabilities i honesty don t know anymore i just don t care if i live or die,0

Whenever I feel a little better something or the other happens in life which ends up pushing me in a downward spiral And lately it s been due to professional position or rather lack of reaching some positions Growing up everyone talked about how smart or whatever I was and all those expectations would really weigh down on me I ve definitely beaten the odds to reach where I have today but I know that if I was in a better place mentally I could ve focused more worked even harder and achieved more Anytime lately I see that I ve not reached where I could ve I just go down for weeks It s not as bad as my normal downward spirals but it happens the most often What should I do to see myself outside of this rat race ,0

How do you finally build up courage to do it I don t want to make compelling post outlining large amounts of grief I see that a lot of people on here have their own problems I just want advice on finally getting the courage to go through with it Lately I ve been thinking about waiting until my uncle goes to work going in his room and finding where he keeps his gun Maybe then driving off someone where maybe enjoy some last moments then off myself At the moment that would be the only thing that would make me happy or put me at rest I ve just been so down I remember this last Christmas instead of going over to my aunts house where all my family was I stayed at home tying a belt around my neck trying to hang myself for the first time Suicide has been on my mind the last 4 years I m 25 now I think I m ready to do it Please help with words or rituals I could use to finally work myself up to ending it all Thanks in advance ,0

I hate being alive I want the pain to end I never thought I would hit 26 let alone the 36 that I am now I am always feeling like I am struggling or fighting to stay afloat to stay alive I am being crushed by debt I ve lost the ability to connect to those around me including my wife and I am a abject failure at being an adult My family wants nothing to do with me my mother tries to steal money from me and I feel like every day I am going to screw up and ruin my life But the rub is that my life is ruins and a stain on the world I just want to fall asleep and never wake up ,0

I ve set the date I feel relieved knowing when it ends It s in the near future the day after my 27th birthday I ll have time to wrap up my business clean up after myself listen one more time through my favourite albums and so on Life started looking a bit more meaningful when I realized I m living my last spring the timing just feels right Not even using a throwaway I ve stopped caring about these things I m simply done with this life I ve had my possibilities and never managed to make anything out of them Now what s left is like it s not only that my mind or body has worn out it s like my soul has worn out I believe in reincarnation perhaps this end times feeling is significant to moving on ,0
I overheard my s o the other day mad and he called me disgusting because on my days off I didn t clean everything I usually clean up when I m making dinner It just hurt a lot to hear the person I care most about say those things I confronted him later and he said he didn t know I heard what he said and that he was embarrassed I m embarrassed I can t even talk about it to anyone I know I just feel so gross and disgusting and I don t want to even be touched by him ,0
Hello everyone 19 M been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now January of this year the person I loved the most and would have given everything dumped me and it s been really rough for me Today I filled my mouth with my anti depressants just couldn t swallow them Is there even a point of trying to live anymore Does it actually get better I truly don t want to be alive anymore I hate every second of it everyday I wake up in so much emotional pain Faking a smile becomes harder and harder I don t know how much longer I can take,0

I used to be strong never needed anybody always enough for myself Then I met him he showed me what I have always been craving for he checked all my tick boxes We moved in together while I was going thru a tough time at work The very first night of us moving in I found out he had been cheating all along with multiple women It s been 2 5 months since that night and I ve begged and begged for him to mend his ways to let me help fix him to just not leave me even if it meant him seeing other people crying day in day out Cutting myself trying to end this suffering Now we live in the same house not talking avoiding each other While he goes out every weekend moving on And I battle with thoughts of suicide and this empty hell of a life I don t know how else to get out of this ,0

so ive had depression for a while but lately it seems to be getting worse I run my own bike repair business out of my house but for the last month or 2 ive just been so tired to do anything just feeling exhausted and heavy The problem is people bring me their bikes to fix when they take longer than expected they call and complain and get angry which leads to me feeling more depressed and more anxiety about answering the phone which leads to more angry calls because im not answering the phone which leads to them coming over to complain but then i really don t wana deal with it so i don t answer the door when they come I realize this is a shit way to run a business and has got to be destroying any reputation i did have i just don t know how to get back to a livable level of life ,0

Hello I m a 17yr old bisexual male in india The last few months I was feeling really sick but didn t have any symptoms so my friend asked me to take a couple of psych tests and they all came back saying I m moderately depressed or severely depressed I have been feeling suicidal for about 3years now ever since I faced bullying in my old school and was hospitalized for liver failure because I tried to kill my self with pills This was 3 years ago Every thing since then has felt extra I lately haven t been able to do anything about it because of my studies I can t seek help because if i tell my parents they will simply discard it saying it s an excuse not to study they re wired that way and I don t have enough money on my own to seek help indipendently Im clueless as to what I m supposed to do,0
Sorry for your loss ,0
It s a weird feeling finally putting my foot downI have finally decided I will kill myself probably by the end of the year I have contemplated this for a long time and I won t change my mind However the transition from idealizing suicide to actually planning it feels very weird I don t know why I won t do it right away even though I believe nothing actually matters especially when you re dead I also don t know whether I should continue to study and work until I actually commit the act Suddenly there are so many technical questions almost taking the pleasure out of my decision I also feel like I m beginning to depersonalize and to feel sad for myself a human being that will soon be dead It s like reading a novel while knowing the ending and not wanting to reach that ending I don t even know why I m posting maybe I just want to hear if anyone else is going through the same thing ,0
It was easier to hold on when my life was worse I ve always had reasons to be sad reasons to feel like shit reasons to want to die I grew up poor and bullied at school My dad was emotionally and physically abusive till I was in my late teens I was addicted to drugs and sofa surfing until I was 20 Now I have a management job that I didn t even have to interview for because they just promoted me without question I don t drink or do drugs except the occasional beer at special events or joint if it s offered I have a flat that feels like home that I share with two of my best friends My relationship with my mum and sister is the best it s ever been I have nothing to be sad about Except I want to die People used to tell me it gets better and it sure as hell does but I still feel like killing myself It was easier when I was just waiting for a situation to be over but now I just feel like I am waiting for my life to be over Why hold on when this is as good as it gets ,0

We made the wiki and this post to make people aware of the potential consequences of getting into private conversations because we know those consequences are hard to foresee We don t mean to paint anyone but although there are definitely predators out there most of the people who offer private contact have nothing but friendly good intentions but they don t have the information needed to understand the risks and downsides of getting into private conversations too early That s not their fault ,0
Days go on and on one way indistinguishable from the other I m 21 haven t done anything in my life Self loathing anixiety never ends It s not like i have gone through anything traumatic and i have already given up on life Timidity has followed me everywhere i can t stand up for my own believes ideas When i think of my future all i see is a depressing lifeless routine Trapped in a life which has no Vitality My parents love me they work very hard and they are so unlucky ill fated to have a son like me who never does something they expect of me i wish there is some technology that can wipe my memories of their brains so that i can kill myself today How set up carbon monoxide at home Any ideas ,0
Okay so I m 19 years old graduated high school and got a few undiagnosed mental health issues I struggle to go to a therapist My parents are practically forcing me to get a job or an internship or anything at all I don t feel well enough to do any of that I literally can t bring myself to get regular house chores done because I m depressed as shit I feel like running away from home but I don t think there is anywhere to go for me because I m technically an adult and nobody cares Besides it would put lots of extra pressure on me if I had to care for my own apartment and stuff like that I feel like I m at an all time low and suicide is also a thought I ve been playing with for a while ,0
I still want to die after my drunk behaviour two months agoI horribly emberassed myself in front of an old school bully verbaly attacking him and then nearly crying when he wanted to punch me Also I basically harassed his girlfriend even grabbing at her and making suggestive comments while everyone told me to fuck off and leave this whole ordeal took mabye 8min At the end I was even actually crying and excusing myself by saying I have depression and anxiety I am pathetic and disgusting I was very drunk and have some mental disorders but alcohol and mental illness are no excuse I deserve every bad thing that is happening with me I cant undersand how I could have been such a person I really deserve to die ,0
I was on lonely as I was feeling that way I come across a reddit user 21F who was dying of stage 4 stomach cancer and she has nobody to tell Looking through her previous posts she s so lonely with no friends in her life I don t even know if she talks to her family at all she never said if she did And I relate to her so much on her loneliness Not only that she s dying of cancer I can t image the emotional pain of dying and not having anyone by your side I wanted to give her a hug and offer her some comfort towards the end Make sure she at least has someone by her side She hasn t posted anything in 2 weeks I think she s dead Do not give this post any awards I feel like that would be insensitive I got so emotional writing this to where I actually cried ,0
Depression can affect anyone It doesn t matter the age ,0
It s really hard doing it aloneEveryone has always said that your friends will be there for you or that the only wrong to do is to not tell anyone what s going on in your life Time and time again I get proven wrong Openly express my feelings of worthlessness and methods of suicide Not a peep from anyone like nothing was said at all Let a close friend know in no uncertain terms that you want to immediately harm yourself It all blows up in your face and everything turns out much worse than how it was before Taking that first step of telling people how miserable I am has never worked out for me the latter half of my life has been a slow snowball of losing touch with all of the people I know through my behavior and expression I ve honestly lost count of all the subgroups I walked away from because I didn t want to burden them and I with inevitably running my mouth Now I sit around alone waiting for something to push me ,0

I m breaking up with my boyfriendThe reason why I m still alive today is my boyfriend He tried to stop me from ending my life many times Now I have an idea of leaving him so no one gonna stop me This might break his heart but I have no choice I don t think I should suffer this life because someone told me to I don t mind being an asshole I wish a planet crashing this Earth everyday so No big deal ,0
I wish I had the strength to try anymore I have nothing and no one and my cries for help go unanswered and even fucking downvoted I wish I never fucking tried for so long that I d given up years ago rather than wasting 15 years hoping life would get better thinking if I just fucking tried hard enough was kind to others and took care of those I loved apply to any job I can life could be better I could be better What a fucking joke 15 years of fucking mental and physical pain 15 years of struggling every fucking day 15 years of ignoring the part of my head that tells me everyone would be happier if I died just fuck it all My life is meaningless and beyond worthless ,0
When I was like 14 I was going through a hard time and getting suicidal thoughts like crazy so I told my dad about it His response was the classic suicide is selfish and then he proceeds to tell me I d get a straight ticket to hell if I killed myself because suicide is the ultimate sin so having learned all this I decided to bear with life a bit longer hoping that life would get better Since then my dad became an alcoholic and my mom took off leaving me and my autistic brother with him I began struggling with my sexuality and started experiencing gender dysphoria and over this past year I started cutting myself I ve never wanted to die more than ever 3 times now I ve held a gun to my head but I was too chicken shit to pull the trigger because I don t want to experience an eternity of torment I m not even sure if I belive that shit anymore I m scared of death but at the same time I just want to escape I feel trapped here how am I supposed to cope with this world There s nothing here for me ,0
Thinking about how I screwed up my life always gets me angry and depressed ,0
Hey so I know that many people here suffer of depression or other issues and that s the reason why I want to found a startup which tries to solve this problem and support anyone who has a mental illness Because of a competition I m going to participate in I have to film a pitch video but I don t want to produce a classical one with for example a powerpoint presentation rather my ambition is to show how a concerned person has to live or how it feels like to live with a mental illness like depression I m going to do sth like a mix of a story and facts shown in between and I was thinking about fading in some quotes or opinions of you guys how you experience or what depression is like for you in one sentence I ll thank you in advance and I hope that I ll be able to help many people with this startup ,0
I feel like everyone else was born with some sort of knowledge about how to function as a person that I just missed somehow How do other people do it How do they make it look so easy I know I can t see inside other peoples heads but it seems like other people just know how to make friends how to do well at school and work how not to be so fucking clumsy and awkward all the time Maybe I was just born defective y know Maybe I was a mistake Maybe there s no point in trying to improve myself anymore I don t even know if improving is even possible I feel like I ll always be two steps behind everyone else Maybe it would be easier to just stop trying ,0
I can t get better anways I m always painted as the bad person I guilt trip people into spending time with me No one really wants to do anything with me I m just that pathetic and people pity me Shouldn t bad people not exist That way maybe the people around me would be happier I can t controbute to anyone s happiness All I do is bring the mood down and be so fucking stupid ,0
forever aloneI ve been alone my whole 27 years of being on this planet Nobody has ever really loved me just acted like it to benefit them in some sort of way soon to be no family The Few friends i do posses have been dropping like flies over the past couple years I am tired of trying in a world where i don t belong I hope that someday soon i can be homeless with just a dog that hopefully loves me then i can just die outside in the cold because i m too much of a pussy to do it myself Best of luck to all of you,0

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 6 months so not very long He s honestly been so amazing supportive and loving but my last relationship that was over a year ago was pretty bad and mentally abusive I love my boyfriend he s so sweet and understanding but I feel like I don t deserve to be loved by him I also feel guilty in a way because I m his first relationship and he s had to deal with me and my depression he s even admitted that sometimes it frustrated him because he doesn t know how to help I want to be with him because he makes me so happy but at the same time I don t want to drag him down with me How do I stop feeling like I m not worthy of being loved by him ,0

I m a 15 year old male with good grades friends and a stable family I want to kill myself On June 10 my History class is taking a field trip where there is a 300 ft drop I am unsure as to whether or not I ll end up jumping but I probably will I had some very strange ideas in my head as a younger kid and I was more than likely schizophrenic It hasn t bothered me in a long time but now that I ve started thinking about the future I remember how I had always feared that things would get frustrating Stress expectations and drama are all things that I fear about my later years in life Death itself which to me isn t scary as nothingness is not unpleasant sounds a lot better The worst part is how I feel as a self aware being I feel as if I m acting out a machine Nothing really phases me like it used to meaning I am constantly thinking about how I am flesh a brain floating on a rock in space I was scared of the dark up until this all started happening I figured I might as well post here just in case ,0

Let s be real it is the part of depression no one discusses Self hygiene just goes out the window If you can t manage the big task just use some mouth wash and wash with a flannel and use a new set of clothes I promise if it has been a few days this will help If you re feeling more able today then change the bedsheets too and brush your teeth with some extra sensitive toothpaste If you can manage a shower that s brilliant pamper yourself and take extra long Get some exfoliating gloves and a pumice stone for your feet If your hair is matted that s ok take a hairbrush and some conditioner Brush from the bottom to the top hold the hair to stop any pain You will get through this good luck,0

When you are autistic people look at you like you are an alien That s my experience pretty much most people in this world care about social status and nothing else It s quite sad but that s why I don t talk to people so much anymore I can t even get accepted into christian circles which sucks It goes to show that when you are weird and different society makes fun of you Suicide rates are high bc people aren t inclusive enough there are alot of lonely people in this world ,0
Would people think it was an accident if i was hit by a train I want to die but it has to look like an accident I think my family would take my death better if it looks like an accident There is a train that passes by every night and i often walk past it I like to go on walks at night I think that would be the easiest way to do it but it might be obviouse that it is a suicide ,0
I think this is the end for me and I would be lying if I said I wasn t scared Truth is I am terrified A part of me always knew it would come to a point where I would eventually give up but I didn t expect it to be so soon I feel like I m in a game with God where he is testing my patience but I am slowly giving up My head is heavy and I don t know how much more I can cry or express the way I am feeling to someone I am well aware the help has to come from within and I have tried I have tried for so long to keep it together For the times I have posted here before thank you to the kind souls who reached out to me and took their time and energy to give me peace of mind For some time it helped ,0
HOLY SH T IM DONE WITH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING,0
Relationship and all around life problems have been tearing me up I have anxiety and panic attacks everyday but at night when I m laying in bed alone everything gets worse I can t eat I can t sleep I don t want to watch tv or talk to Anyone I don t want to go into my problems but the stress is over powering lately and I can t cope no more I feel like giving up on everything it I can t even do that because giving up with make things harder I m too pussy to kill my Self and I just don t know what to do it s hard to move forward feeling this way I can t get anything done I ve went to a doctor and got a prescription for some depression anxiety meds it doesn t seem to be working at all,0
 I have a really hard time because I am unhappy about a lot of things in my life and I cannot look at some situations from a positive angle I am just negative indifferent about them This makes it harder for me to keep and make friends because I people are so put off by negativity People don t like complaining For example if you go to a horrible family event let s say and people ask how it went they really want you to say it was great They want to hear the positive stuff If you say you re not close to your family no one wants to keep talking to you I can t lie so I am just being myself but it s not fully acceptable I remember when I was a child and I was naive and ignorant I was positive about a lot of things Then it was so much easier to make friends I sometimes meet adults like that and I definitely feel that I m expected to be like that But part of me feels like it s either luck bragging showing off ignorance and naivet or straight up lying inauthenticity ,0

I genuinely feel like I can t do it anymore I m exhausted I feel trapped in a job I hate that I don t make much money doing so I m stuck in a shitty one bedroom apartment with my boyfriend He doesn t have a job and probably won t be able to find one I ve been trying for 6 months to find a new job and I can t My apartment is disgusting and I have no energy to clean it I don t want to see my family who basically tells me to be grateful I have a job at all and that I should swallow my feelings My only friend is just as if not more depressed than I am I want to die but my guilt complex is so strong I couldn t do that to the few people I have in my life ,0

I started training martial arts boxing must thai jiu jitsu 8 years ago and I ve found it to be one of the best things to help me maintain a good mental state It s great for endorphins it s social in a way that s quite structured which helps me if I m socially anxious it s a hobby that people find interesting and you get the confidence that comes with knowing how to handle yourself Has anyone else found that something similar works for them Would you try it If not why not ,0

For some context I ve had a history of being on Antidepressants having taken them alongside Strattera throughout elementary After a long ish time after that I 16 17 at the time had gone to my doctor about struggling with depression and anxiety which was affecting my school performance pretty heavily My primary physician attempted to put me on an increased form of my old meds After a few weeks time I felt mostly the same even on Zoloft I was placed on Duloxetine for a while and I still felt awful no matter what I did My doctor kept telling me to give it time that my irregularity was just making it more difficult but I was just waiting for weeks at a time for the feelings or anything to come back It never did I haven t really been taking anything for a long while now I don t really know what to do or if anything could actually help me ,0
I m diagnosed with depression I ll be starting meds most likely Zoloft since things aren t getting better with therapy One big symptom of my depression is low energy I can t even go out to the grocery store and if I do go somewhere I feel so shitty and exhausted My dad won t give me a fucking break and always pressures me to go out even though I already have that day and I m just so tired and sick of being here He thinks he s helping my depression but is actually making it worse Does Zoloft help with this My psychiatrist said that Zoloft and Prozac help with the low energy that comes with depression My mom and grandma also are on used to be on Zoloft for depression and it helped for my mom at least My psych said it should help with my anxiety also This is my first time on psych meds so I rlly hope I can find the right one for me ,0

Endless cycleLive to work Work to die What s the point anymore Why should I work if I don t want to support myself Most jobs in life are pointless mundane and I can t do it anymore Fuck,0
I ve attempted suicide 3 times in the last 24 hours I don t think it ll get any betterI m feeling so awful and shitty My friends are all terrified that i wotn make it to tomorrow and I don t want to make it to tomorrow I want my life to be over ,0
What if the person in question is in the verge of committing suicide ,0
Actually wanting to dieI read so many posts here of people that want to die because of a terrible situation they re in which seems endless for them I often hear people say You don t want to die you just don t want to live the life you re living now and thats probably true for most people but how do you cope when you ctually want to die I don t want a life at all I m not in a bad situation i m not going through something tramatic I just don t have a will to live to do anything no motivation I don t think I ever had ,0
Basically telling people about my depression has only made me more depressed because they accuse me of things I realize the more I tell people the more isolated I become in my feelings No one can fix me at this point I have to rely on meds and therapy for the rest of my life which aren t even adequate I m just suffering every day until I build up the courage to shoot myself in the brain My dad threatened to send me to the hospital because I kept screaming to relieve myself from PTSD I don t want to study or go to school anymore Everything is meaningless to me anyway ,0
I ve moved from dark thoughts and deep depression into compete emptiness and emotional numbness And it feels worse I have no idea how to accurately describe it Things that have been somewhat helping me cope simply seem so pointless now I can t feel any strong emotions positive or negative And this isn t really a neutral state It s Complex I can feel that I don t like it And that s about it Both on an emotional level and a physical one ,0
Ha my family member was the same Not sure how many times he offended but at least 3 His rehab was more like a spa He even had good insurance that fixed his teeth and gave him new eyeglasses Also he drives without a license now Kinda makes you want to take up substances so you can get in on those sweet resources eh For legal reasons THIS IS A JOKE ,0
Men should stop leaving up in a shattered state of emotional insanity ,0
ComfortingHere it is again like a warm blanket pulled over my shoulders It presses hard and keeps me still I knew you d be back dear one Though I moved feigning absence of you I could sense you lingering Behind each door I shut Posed in the backseat To swallow swallow down into the depths Into heavy comforting deep ,0
I have been feeling really slow recently I do eat a lot of meat but twice a week I drink alcohol and eat little which affects zinc I also have auto immune In past my zinc was ok but at that point I believe i was taking 50mg a day so perhaps without that I could be low Anyway haven t had much for a while and I have a large spot on my back and tiny spot on face can be sign of zinc Felt like a zombie can t think clearly and feel starry and negative slow thoughts So is zinc been helpful for others and best dose ,0
My life is fine I m pretty lucky actually but I can t stop feeling utterly miserable bored and alone There s nothing to do and I can t bring myself to do anything Anytime I start something I always want to stop after a couple of weeks This has been going on for as long as I can remember I wish I could just maintain an interest in something I feel left out and unable to connect with others too I just feel so trapped I m just so unhappy I ve tried so hard to change it but I always have this cloud hanging over me ,0
I don t want to deal with life anymore I just want to go to sleep and come back in a few months I really just need a break and I m so exhausted from everything ,0
When you become numbYou know you re reaching the end when after 15 years of severe depression and anxiety you now no longer feel feelings at all Like I can fake them But I feel dead inside 100 I know depressed people say that all the time even I did but now I truly do feel dead inside It s a strange feeling,0
Understandable This is more of a psychological group than a sociological one if that makes sense ,0
Support for anyone struggling with thoughts of suicide as the community info states ,0
Really sorry that you didn t have a good response to your post here Trying to make sure everybody gets quality supportive replies here is a larger issue but preventing incitement deliberate or accidental is part of it We re always thinking about how to help the helpers and we re working on some resources behind the scenes as our time permits ,0
The only thing keeping me alive is my childBut lately I think she s better off with a mother who isn t mentally ill Her father and I split and he would be able to find her someone better My parents wouldn t have to worry about me Anyone can hire a new nurse my job wouldn t miss me I m so tired of not being good enough I m never good enough and I just want it to stop,0
my attention isnt good enoughmy friend who blocked me wasnt on the internet for a whiel and her other friend basically checked up on her publicly and she said that she appreciates it alot because noone s ever checked up on her like this before which is not true because i checked up on her everyday like i hope you re okay i hope youre gonna have a nice day and stuff and she s not the first person who did something like that to me so i think that noone appreciates my attention because they realize that its not really worth much as i dont have many people to talk to ,0
I used to be strong never needed anybody always enough for myself Then I met him he showed me what I have always been craving for he checked all my tick boxes We moved in together while I was going thru a tough time at work The very first night of us moving in I found out he had been cheating all along with multiple women It s been 2 5 months since that night and I ve begged and begged for him to mend his ways to let me help fix him to just not leave me even if it meant him seeing other people crying day in day out Cutting myself trying to end this suffering Now we live in the same house not talking avoiding each other While he goes out every weekend moving on And I battle with thoughts of suicide and this empty hell of a life I don t know how else to get out of this ,0
Don t exactly want to die but I m not really bothered by living either I ve been getting healthy Taking my meds almost every day Found the right combo of medication Seeing a therapist etc The usual Until tonight I can t seem to find a job the one I desperately want I know I won t get I haven t got a single penny to my name I just feel useless and without direction WTF am I to do with my life Not to mention the fact I ve gained 40lbs and can t seem to shed it no matter what I do I ve got a little bit of Klonopin prescribed to me that s left I never wanted to abuse it again I ve had some close calls but I can t help but love the numbness it gives me I ve taken 4 5mg and currently drinking a bottle of wine Hoping the husband doesn t find out I just moved back to the U K too so the MH care here is well shit Anyone been in this spot Does it get better Does anyone even know what they want to do with their lives ,0
I m self loathing once again I have no idea what the future holds for me and I have no real control over my life situation This feels like a dead end I don t know if me writing stuff on here helps me in anyway but I just wanna feel heard I wanna save my friends the burden of having to hear all this stupid shit I know someone out there is reading this thank you I hope this feeling doesn t last forever and I really hope reincarnation is not a thing because holy shit Idk what to do with my self,0
I just can t take it I been pushed around mental health services being lied to and having my rights violated that certain actions were performed When they have not such as being told I went to a and e because I liked the attention also not having after care when I was Discharge from cahms having to wait 4 months before even referred to the adult team and having to wait 3 more months to wait And being told after a particularly bad episode by the acute mental health team that I should just stop drinking then I was told that a consultant psychiatrist would decide whether I should sectioned but never heard back Then I was just dumped with more medication and having to be visited by the crisis team that I should just distract myself and just expected until to wait for threapy If I could anything without consequences I would fucking kill every single one of them condescending bustards for not giving me proper mental health care and expected to be cool with it,0

I ve already attempted s icide once and I ve only been here for 2 days I m so angry it didn t work ,0
Every day is PHYSICAL PAIN I want that to be the primary reason here I suffer from constant numbness tingling burning sensations in my fingers and feet my mouth is beyond fucked and I have no real health insurance ty america I hate my ethnicity and I ll never be comfortable in my own skin I m poor as fuck and soon I ll have to move out which means I ll have to work even more hours which is already suicide bait It s bad and only getting worse Staying alive only prolongs my pain and the end result will be the same either way so it s pretty silly i keep hanging on for no reason ,0

I always thought I was a strong person For many months now I have been feeling weak and just miserable I feel pathetic and meaningless I ve been down on myself and everything is just extremely underwhelming Most days I don t leave my bed I ve been sick and don t really eat much anymore I drink so much water I feel like a damn plant So that s a plus But the mental abuse I deal with along with everyone and everything letting me down is just a huge issue I used to look forward to waking up and going about my day And now I look forward to maybe one or two things in my life I m stuck in a downward spiral and I don t see myself getting out of it anytime soon I used to be such an incredibly happy person Always tried to look on the brighter side of things Now Ha I feel like I don t belong I can t take this anymore ,0
I like to play with my friends in my head and have fun that s the only thing keeping me happy while I lay in my bed doing nothing and waiting for my friends to maybe one day invite me to play games and all of even hang out somewhere I m still waiting All I have is myself and when I feel sad it s always me who come to rescue myself first I have no one to laugh with and to share stories with just me and me in my room just imagining I dunno what I did wrong or what am I doing wrong but all I know is I m gonna always wait for them and they will always have a home here ,0
I am so sorry I understand you are not Tech support I am just looking for help I do not wish to remain alive ,0

LostI work in retail and the company I work for is staying open because we are thriving in non essential sales right now I used to love my job before this started never had any complaints I was struggling with my mental health before this started though and now I feel hopeless 90 of our customers are shopping because they re bored but they re all also disgustingly rude and aggressive The company gave us a 2per hour raise but now I m actually making LESS money in my paychecks even though I m working more hours If I was on unemployment I would be making double my usual pay I have no good options I m unhappy in and out of work I think about killing myself on a daily basis and I barely see a point in trying to continue The only thing stopping me is my dog honestly But idk how to fix how I feel because everything I feel like could help me isn t a possibility I dont know what to do I feel lost ,0

Okay thank you ,0
I think this is a good rule thanks Someone s who s depressed doesn t need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it then maybe feeling even more like no one cares Besides perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM s ,0
I m 26m and currently feel like if my life doesn t drastically improve financially socially etc I ll be even more depressed at 30 or 35 however I still have some hope and optimism for marriage kids and having better friends I at least want to give myself a chance to improve my life without even trying or pursuing a career path that s more beneficial I obviously can t ignore economics inflation which will become worse and amplify the thoughts I have but I am extremely frugal just need to tackle making more money so that also gives me hope Has anyone else gone through a similar through process I find that I m more at ease over dying in an airplane or any freak accident because I ve given myself this 5 10 year window This is definitely not the healthiest approach I should still consult a psychiatrist or some formal help but wanted to know if someone has had a similar mindset and ended up living a happy life afterwards Thanks,0
I often ponder what it s like on the side it must be so peaceful and serene with no one to bother you or insult you I feel as though my life is just sick and miserable joke ,0

A cowardI think I understand why I don t want to live I m scared of growing up of the adult world of the responsabilities I m not suicidal I m just a coward who is too scared to live like normal people do I cowardly hope to die as soon as possible to run away from any responsabilities but I m too scared to do it myself to end it myself I m a disgusting coward who can t do something as simple as living like an adult A 20 years old coward who should have run away sooner How thought Pain scare me Death scare me But live do as well I don t want to die Or do I What do I want then I want everything to just stop Coward Just die then ,0
I feel ok and then suddenly sad and I start crying with no particular reason I don t know if it s because of my longterm problem or just for no reason at all I m just wondering if there always has to be a reason to feel sad cry ,0
Some days I feel like I m getting better Other days I hope that I might disappear if I m lucky I love my life but I think I hate myself I feel like nothing I do is good enough or worth anything I feel like my son doesn t love me I feel like I m not my own person like my life doesn t matter I m just a support character for whoever I m around I don t have someone I can talk to I don t know what else to say How do pull yourself out of a hole like this I m so tired ,0
I struggle with thoughts of suicide frequently and there are very few things that keep me going I already posted about what I can do to help her on other subs so please don t take this as me only being concerned with myself please please I just don t know what I ll do if she goes through with it ,0
I worked in hospital administration for a similar place and would never put myself in one Those places are toxic The nurses and staff constantly mock the patients behind their backs and there were 5 staff on patient rapes while I was there that is now a lawsuit in which I have provided testimony for the victims Disgusting Outpatient has potential I guess I should look,0
As the title states why does it feel easy to push people away when you re depressed Especially people that are not aware of your depression and mental issues It feels so much easier to push them away compared to telling them on repeat about your dark thoughts like a broken record ,0

I m useless and I wish I could commit suicide without my mom doing the same afterYep My mom and dad were discussing my mental health after I turned off my phone and cut myself off from everyone and he told me she said that I mean my my parents and my siblings are all depressed to some degree so I don t even doubt that But like I dropped out of college I m gonna lose my job I run away from stressful stimuli like my life depends on it which is ironically ruining my life and bringing more stressful stimuli I m fucking stuck here and it killed my soul years ago Personality wise I m not meant to exist in this world I hate doing anything I m a lazy piece of shit I hate people in general I m not a very pleasant person to be around I m rather selfish Why should I fucking bother Maybe there used to be light at the end of the tunnel but it feels like I just kept smoking cigarettes next to a pile of dynamite ,0
This world is trash my fellow humans are the reason it would be ignorant of me to point out to every human being but I have had my fair share of inconsiderate people you try your best to mean something to someone you give your all and put your heart on the line personally I never trusted people thanks mom and dad Great job but as the frog and scorpion who were crossing the river the frog trusting the scorpion was it s downfall the scorpion couldn t resist its nature And yes the same applies to human beings I trusted someone for the first time in a long while I was even excited I was human again I could feel I could smile I was happy with all good things comes the peak then a violent vertical decline my trust was betrayed my insides shattered into a million pieces nothing is left I m slowly turning back to hollow a husk and that s the way it s suppose to be I suppose happiness exist it just wasn t made for me,0

I have been having suicidal thoughts for months I feel I do not want to talk to any of my friends or families anymore because I m hurting them by being depressed They are supportive but a lot of them cried and my parents get depressed too because I m depressed Therapy and medication has not been helpful I might try intensive outpatient programs I do not know what to do anymore I text some crisis line sometimes but when they ask me about suicidal thoughts I always say no Because I m afraid that they will disclose this to my school and when my school knows about this it s very troublesome as I have experienced Or they will call the police to come over ,0
how to get euthanized at a young age i know it s impractical and nigh impossible especially for someone who lives in america and isn t even 20 years old but i sometimes wish i could get euthanized rather than leaping off a bridge or taking some pills which aren t guaranteed to work it just sounds nicer to do it calmly with the people you love ,0
my boyfriend is constantly doing stuff for me or buying me flowers and dinner meanwhile I feel like I do nothing for him i put my everything into my last relationship and it drained me so I don t even feel like doing the cutsie little things like leaving him notes because my heart is so broken And it isn t because I am not ready for a relationship it has been over 2 years I usually get all excited when hr gets me stuff but recently it has been all too much because I don t feel like I deserve it I don t deserve all he does for me and in my state of depression I have no idea how I can even begin to repay him I have no idea how I can thank him because I m so broke and I am broken Every time he does nice things now I just feel like the worst person ever and it makes me so upset that he gives me so much of himself when I am so broken and truly don t deserve it Obviously I have not expressed any of this to him because I don t want to seem ungrateful,0

I have to apply for jobs here again and the thought of it leaves me cold There are so many bad memories to go back to I can t process them all I feel as though I m drowning My body is suffering I ve been having thoughts of suicide on and off in my mind I don t know how to fix it this time There is no solution anymore No real hope No real victory or way out of it all For the first time it seems not just flashbacks or critical thoughts But real reality that my instincts were right That my future is behind me and ending it permanently is the only way ,0
At least that s what I m thinking right now I feel so out of place in this world like I wasn t meant to be here I m worthless and I all I do is be in the way of people and make people feel awkward with the way that I look Sometimes I want to hide in a ditch far away from other people or submerge myself in an ocean where the waves can fill my ears and all around my head and just drown out everything I ve given up on telling people in my life about what going on in my head because nobody wants to hear it even if they say that they do If they do it worries them or they just forget about it I m tired I m really tired I hate myself like crazy one minute and don t the next Even when I don t I really do deep down ,0
I want to die all the time its just the fear that stops it It s getting worse and I dont have access to therapyI don t have any family except my partner and my mental health is ruining our relationship I don t think it will ever get better My partner is so stuck on me that they are willing to pour unlimited energy into trying to make me better but they can t because they are my partner not a professional pyschiatrist So they try to push me to fight certain things when they start happening and when I give up we fight I just want to not be afraid I just want it to stop ,0

I am tired of thinking I often tell my therapist that I am thinking of calling it quits but I never do I really wish I had the courage to just to ahead and do it but I am so afraid Not of dying but of accidentally surviving I don t want to be that person that wakes up in the hospital surrounded by people who are just pretending to care to save face I am also afraid of what will happen to my kid I know parents are supposed to live for their little ones but I can t Still I do not want my flaws to affect her as she ages Honestly I should have given her up when she was born but I was selfish I listened to the people who told me that things would get better And now it is to late She is to old for people to want to adopt her I refuse to live her in the hands of the people who aid in me hating myself I am so very tired ,0
Something I wrote during my hard time It was another night It was another episode The burdens I had in my mind Even my thoughts couldn t control It was the same tub The songs were the same I just felt so numb While I acted sane The water was hot Yet the chills made it cold I had a razor on my right About which I felt bold Everything felt depressed While nothing could be expressed The razor went deep And so did the blood The water turned cold While I witnessed a flood The water turned red And so did my face The walls turned darker On which laid an apology Written with a marker I carried no regrets And so do I now As I woke up in the hospital Witnessing my life frown PS I m glad nothing really worked out back then I m still going through shit but I m fighting to live another day If you re ever going through shit and need someone to just vomit it all on I m right here fam take care redditors we got this ,0

In a bad placeA couple of years ago I tried to commit suicide I ve been trying to process my attempt and it s bringing up a lot of feelings again Those feelings have been really bad these past few weeks and it scares me Above all it s the feelings of being a burden that are the worst For instance my co worker mentioned she was looking for a new apartment and that she was stressed about it I immediately thought wow there are so many healthy people that could be renting my apartment right now I know it s fucked up Then when I think I might need to reach out about these feelings it makes me even more guilty My family and friends have emotional energy that could be used towards something someone that benefits the world It sounds self pitying and indulgent but that s truly the first thing that comes to mind I feel like I am broken ,0
It s sad when certain so called friends just stop talking to you I met a coworker at a new job and we quickly hit it off and became friends We made all sorts of plans to meet up outside work you know just have fun Time passes and you slowly stop talking and then basically he erases you from all social media doesn t text stuff like that Guys are weird when you don t give them what they want That s what I think was the reason I later found out he was in a relationship married but he said he wasn t Am I dumb for trying to be friends I guess so ,0

Been thinking to jump off my balcony So this is new I ve never actually imagined to do anything to actually harm myself it was just fleeting thoughts of what if I don t wake up tomorrow I don t think there s really any intention to jump I just think about it repeatedly Not the fall or the impact to the ground just the jump on loop kinda like in a third person POV videogame I see someone from behind jumping and I know it s me I can t sleep I don t think I will tonight It will be the second night in under a week I think I m not sure time is fuzzy Copy and pasted from suicidology because maybe this subreddit is more accurate ,0
Does anyone else ever feel invisible I just feel like I don t matter My voice is never heard My feelings aren t valid or my opinions are not smart enough My family members never let me finish a complete thought Someone always wants to finish my sentence and it couldn t be further from what I am trying to say It hurts to feel like I m not a complete person I havent always been around my family due to being in active addiction most of my young adult life But now I m in recovery 4 yrs and I m around them all the time They don t make me feel bad about my past but I feel like I don t get the same respect as everyone else It s frustrating and I just want to be heard ,0

If I had to give advice it would be this The best way to honor someone s death is to act like they never died and to live your life like you normally would The reason being that I am sure that your dog would not like to see you distraught You should also celebrate their life and to cherish the memories you have them rather than mourn their death And I m sure one day you ll see them in the sky and in the stars Time Heals All Wounds But It Does Not Heal All Suffering ,0

I m diagnosed with depression I ll be starting meds most likely Zoloft since things aren t getting better with therapy One big symptom of my depression is low energy I can t even go out to the grocery store and if I do go somewhere I feel so shitty and exhausted My dad won t give me a fucking break and always pressures me to go out even though I already have that day and I m just so tired and sick of being here He thinks he s helping my depression but is actually making it worse Does Zoloft help with this My psychiatrist said that Zoloft and Prozac help with the low energy that comes with depression My mom and grandma also are on used to be on Zoloft for depression and it helped for my mom at least My psych said it should help with my anxiety also This is my first time on psych meds so I rlly hope I can find the right one for me ,0

Plans If you would like to hear my plans for suicide I have two and they are both flawless I am actually proud of this one So first pour a energy drink into a blender then add 900 mg of Vyvanse 90mg of paliperidone 300mg of Zoloft then blend it all up After blending this up I put a noose around my neck I drink the cocktail and inject a epipen epinephrine into my neck then hop If you are unfamiliar with these medications basically Vyvanse caffeine and epinephrine are all stimulants that will when taken together in such quantities will destroy my cardiovascular system The anti psychotic and depressant have known adverse reactions The second is much simpler Fill the bath tub with flammable liquids and maybe some solids to keep it burning Then submerge and ignite ,0

My girlfriend just gave me 2 weeks I m literally texting this is the bathroom and trying not to sob She has struggled for so long and tried so hard and tonight she said that she wanted to truly end it all We made an agreement when we first started dating 3 years ago that if either of us wanted to brake up with the other that we could say no for two weeks and then we had to accept it It was a cute little thing just to say that we really couldn t lose the other But now after about an hour of crying she said I had 2 weeks before she would brake up with me and end it all I honestly have no idea where to go with this She did therapy some over the summer but they only gave her lexapro for anxiety and nothing for actual depression I don t know what to do where to go or how to help I want to get her medication to help but if she is serious about the 2 weeks time then I don t know how Please anyone help ,0
I ve heard that one before from my dad many times No she s not right you can t just pretend you re not depressed that s not how depression works depression is an illness caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain you don t choose to be or not to be depressed Being sad is very different from being depressed If you feel depressed please seek help don t rely on your parents opinion they re not therapists and most of the times they don t fully understand your feelings Please don t let it grow out of control like it happened to me ,0

I know i will die by suicide im fifteen years old and since i was 11 years old all i can think about is which way is the most peaceful way to go The only thing stopping me is goals and ambitions i want to accomplish before dying i dont know what im going to do if these goals aren t achieved but i have to complete them before dying Also the thought of my poor mother walking in on her only sons dead rotting corpse makes me think twice about killing myself But im so tired i just want it all to end i just want to be at peace with the universe and leave this sad pathetic world,0

For more than a year now I have been waking up feeling like shit Most of times there is no apparent reason it has become kind of a morning ritual My head pounds I feel extreme sadness and I really struggle to go about my daily chores The situation improves as the day progresses and by mid day noon I am able to do my job without much problem But recently the morning depression has been getting worse accompanied by vivid dreaming every night Now when I wake up I am more depressed than ever sometimes I think why did I stop dremaing why I had to wake up and I will not lie some bad thoughts have crossed my mind recently Feeling really helpless now what should I do ,0
Please God if you re listeningLet me die as I sleep I am done feeling like this ,0
I think to have depression and anxiety but I never had a real prove of this maybe is because I am super timid and I can barely talk to anyone including of my family I ve been so close and kept everything to myself that I fear even to ask for professional help because I fear to look weak or not enough at the eyes of someone else I can understand this can seems odd because right now I m exposing myself to a lot of people but I forced myself to do this with the last drops of love for myself that I have and I just hope to get even the slightest help from this ,0

Me and my girlfriend before we started dating talked for a little over a month After that period I went MIA because I wasn t in the best mental state to be talking to people and didn t want to hurt us I was MIA for a month and I returned and I apologized for not talking for so long and it ended making things worse That night my girlfriend and I started a FaceTime And she was in a bathroom She said chase look very gleeful and had blood coming down her wrist I was in shock I talked about later with her and she said she did self harming because I was gone for so long that when she saw me she had the urge to cut herself Her cutting herself has been a thing for a little bit now but I ve been recently depressed because I made her do that I just want to puke thinking of what me being gone did to her I worry that if I ever left she d cut and maybe kill herself I worry that I might need to take a week break from reality And I m stressing about it somewhat becoming into a depressed state 24 7 What do I even do ,0

I just want it all to endI just can t take it anymore I just want it all to end For the past few weeks I ve been contemplating it It s not like anyone would miss me I have zero friends aside from my girlfriend and she can do better better than the terrible person she has for a lover now We don t even live in the same country let alone the same continent My parents could do without me as a freeloader make their lives easier My half brother doesn t even like me It seems like a win win situation I just want it to end just fade away into nothing or even if there is an afterlife something where there is no pain if I can t hold out tonight i don t know EDIT I just told my girlfriend She laughed in my face and told me to stop being emo WELP ,0
VI Seconds Etika Hello there I have decided to share this song with you guys I believe it is visceral and can help a person when they ve entered into a bad episode Depression and self termination are very serious topics but I do believe it ought to be less stigmatized and discussion should be had more openly as opposed to hushed whispers on grey rainy days When I was experiencing bad days this artist and his songs helped me get through those days just by letting out a lot of the negativity through his own struggles he put to music form I do want to warn you though that this song might be triggering depending on how sensitive you are to ideas of self termination and those stuck feelings we might all experience I hope you all the best ,0
Okay so I 18F from Germany just had the worst day in my live I can t go any further I am laying I m my bed Silently crying so that noone will hear I pretended to be asleep so that my mom wouldn t notice that I m crying I can t close my eyes anymore cause I wouldn t be able to stop crying Everything is getting worse and I have noone to talk to Noone who s there for me No friends No family I m alone and I can t live like that anymore ,0

Do therapist ever help I am contemplating seeing a therapist but I don t actually know what I will get out of it I think I am kind of depressed right now but for the most part me wanting to kill myself was not because of depression It s a logical decision based on my own reasoning I think a lot of people see a therapist for medication if I don t want medication is it mostly a waste of time I guess I want someone to listen and maybe surprise me with an insight angle I have not thought of I am also afraid I ll be sent to a hospital if I am being too honest I m getting better but I m really just taking it one day at a time The future scares me and I don t have motivation to do anything other than sitting at home after work To me it s actually more comforting to think about dying than to live ,0
i just cant stop thinking about suicideeverything i do never seems to be good enough somewhere out there there are thousands of other 15 year olds that have the exact same skills that i do and way more i have come to terms with the fact that no one will ever notice me and i will never make an impact on anything my grades are plummeting people are abandoning me and starting to be assholes to me way more often i am giving up whenever i have any sort of small failure my first thought is that i should just fucking end it already i would feel very bad if i actually did it as my gf has also tried before and if i succeeded she probably would try and succeed too my idea is to slowly push away everyone so that when i finally do end it no one will be that upset i just want everyone to be happy ,0
I ve officially hit rock bottom Not only a few days ago did I ask a girl out and to my surprise she said yes to it only to ghost me and never respond when I tried to follow up and see where to pick her up at on the day of and not only today did I get rejected badly by a girl I approached when I was out shopping but then I come home as well to my safe haven of sorrow and opened snap and saw I had a few new adds so I snapped them and every single one left me on open that s not even the worst part two of them blocked me right away another one unadded and the other 2 or 3 just didn t respond after they left me on open My record is uncountable atp with the amount of losses I ve took it maybe somewhere between 0 450 or 0 500 the only consistency is the amount of wins being zero The way it looks being an 18 year old guy not having a single positive experience with the opposite sex that I could look back on and smile when I think bout it seems like im jus gonna be a lonely virgin for life why man,0
High on Cocaine by myself not immediate danger but badly need someone to talk to I am not in immediate danger but I am very high and would be very appreciative for someone to IM with or talk on the phone I am 22 years old failing out of college using drugs frequently possibly taking a medical withdrawal from school due to crushing sadness i need human interaction and can t bear to unveil my sadness to someone i know i have hidden and kept it in for so long it is destroying my life ,0
I ve never wished for death like I do now I want to go to a forest in the middle of the night and deepthroat a shotgun I want to be free from this I want to feel happy again I want to feel anything positive again ,0
i m so hyper aware that all my thoughts are unjustified and untrue but I just can t shake the constant feelings of thinking everyone is against me or that I have nobody that truly cares I think that I push people away because i m so scared of any kind of rejection or getting hurt I m just always looking for acceptance from others I don t remember the last time I was truly happy I m just constantly lying to myself and others I m a complete fake and I don t know how to deal with it anymore Why does my brain even though I know it s wrong convince me that I m better off alone better off not here even and I can t do anything to change it I want so much from my life and set the bar so high for myself but I can t seem to achieve anything because I fall down at the first hurdle Idek why I m writing this just so confused ,0

No one seems to know about my pain All of ppl around me have always said to me that I know you re in hard time but there s no way so keep struggling They actually don t know I ve tried to reveal my pain to my parents but it has always failed It makes me sick Very sick I m living today cuz I didn t die at yesterday I just wanna end this terrible life and don t wanna open my eyes at the morning I already wrote my will to spread to the ppl around me when I die And I m losing myself rapidly And I m losing the fear of death If I die they will understand my pain They ll know my pain And they ll be sad becuz they should have cared me more ,0
post suicidali can t help but notice how tone deaf ppl r like i m Trying my hardest to recover and ur just being uncomfortable and calling me weird the way they feel more comfortable filling up my place than saving it after a period of introspection i ve realized my only solace is self destruction and mindless fake deep entertainment but im down with frying my brain beats the shit out of living with my thoughts everyday that s it i like living i love having my life together exercising control over it it s just my thoughts my emotions i can t deal with them i need a distraction But i cant focus in the first place so vodka B movies and lana del rey it is,0
I don t want to kill myself but I can t shake the thought Borderline obsessive I ve been struggling for a while with depression and God knows what else insurance coming soon hopefully then therapy for the first time hopefully leading to some diagnoses so I know how to handle myself I have a good support system but I don t know how to properly express what I am thinking to him like I don t want to downplay the severity of where I am but I don t want to discredit myself by inflating reality I m sure this is normal but does anyone know how to handle this ,0
WordsDoes anybody here can say something like I do not really like mi life If I can end it I would do it not giving it importance It s a bad example But it s the best example that I can imagine Because I know it s something really strange that you can heard someone stranger telling you his intentions of dieying But you can imagine a specific situation with a trustworthy person And the matter about suicide only show up and then you say something like that I don t like my life or I really want to dissapeared because I don t tolerate this society That person will care about you That s ia my case I can hurt myself or don t caring of my body by a hurt or anything I really don t think a lot of the consequences of my actions for all I do myself Because I really don t care And I don t want to sound a bad person or anything but when someone worries about me when I don t doing it it s strange It is a waste of time ,0
I m just sick of life I can t deal with the pain I feel like such a burden I just want support and someone to listen ,0
Im at the fucking end i can not and want not to live anymore Sometimes i laugh and be happy but that is just for short times because i dont realise the sadness when i am fake happy but i constantly have suicidal thoughts and often they are very strong I think and plan for the last few weeks and constantly search for a good way for suicide but i think my perfectionism and ocd is the only reason because i dont find a worthy way to die I am the person that searches for help but then does not accept it I dont know what i should do i just want to dissappear in peace ,0
What s the point My life will never be worth a fuck to me I want someone else s life not my dog shit existence I ll never be anything I want to be yet I can never bring myself to do it I couldn t kill myself if I wanted to I wish someone could just shoot me in the head ,0

I m 27 and attempted suicide for the first timeI don t expect to live the rest of my life without another life ending breakdown and I also know now how not to fail the attempt again The only thing holding me back right now is knowing how devastated my family would be but when I was in the black hole of the first attempt that didn t even cross my mind Anti depressants are helping I guess My therapists tell me that I m doing really well they tell me I have good instincts and they tell me I m kicking ass at the therapy But I don t trust myself So do I trust them or my own instincts Being that close to ending everything puts me that much closer yet ,0

What do you think its like I ve obviously not done it yet but what do you think goes through someones mind like before then the run up to and then actually committing suicide No doubt its different for everyone but I m wondering For reference yes I m not in the best way right now Physically I m healthy I m in a job I don t like I have no friends I have a girlfriend I have somewhat a family But I m not happy I have things going my way and things not going my way How can I feel as if doing this is going to release me I don t want to keep going on but I don t know why I m lost on this Any and all help is appreciated thank you for reading this far ,0
I m doneLife is too hard I spent my life until now thinking my anxiety problems were all because of my social issues but now that I actually have solid friends I realize that was never the case and I still don t know why I m anxious Do you know how it feels to have an anxiety attack in front of everyone you care about I just Don t know what to tackle Therapy doesn t work time doesn t work self care doesn t work I just want to die I JUST WANT TO DIE AND I KNOW HOW STUPID IT SOUNDS BECAUSE MY PROBLEMS ARE RELATIVELY MINOR I m sorry I hope you didn t waste too much time reading this I don t even know why I posted ,0
Looking for inputI recently crossed a threshold The biggest thing holding me back from suicide previously was guilt over how my friends and family would feel over it I ve grown isolated enough over the last year that this doesn t really factor in anymore I find myself making plans and beginning to act on them on a daily basis but decide to go do something else first and just perpetually putting it off Is anybody else at this stage right now I m pretty torn up emotionally and essentially ran to my only real friend to hang out of fear of being alone I m usually pretty ambivalent to the prospect but lately it has seemed like a much more inviting choice and my willingness to kill myself is really scaring me How do I make it out of this ,0
When i hit depression at some point i just feel empty and just full of darkness I havent seen my friends in so long too I wake up angry knowing life is hard for me Life is a bit tough for me now well it is to me and my family Im afraid my family wont lose the house Since we still have to pay for the house And we still gotta buy tickets for my brothers so they could come here since we havent seen them in so long Man i miss them so much I remember in dec i was sick and depressed cos my mom and dad was gonna get a divorce but thankfully not My mom is also old im afraid i might lose her before im 18 i cried in pain Please dont get angry at me in the comments im just venting here since i dont have anybody to talk to and if i talk to any of my family members they will just say U can remove ur depression but it was so hard to remove it Any helpful messages will help,0

What are my options I had a breakdown in the car this week because I realized that the only thing getting me through the day anymore is the thought that I might be able to save up enough money to buy a gun I don t want to go through therapy and live I want to die But that would make my loved ones very upset I don t have money to pay for proper treatment but it s become increasingly clear to me that help from strangers can t really cut it I need to know what my options are because I physically can t continue like this anymore Is there any way that I can seek out affordable psychiatric treatment in my area I ve tried researching it and haven t found anything useful I live in Worcester MA if that makes a difference ,0

Today is the death anniversary for my nephew We lost him to a tragic drowning accident 9 years ago He was two when he passed away and I was the only one in my family that ever got to meet him and be with him I helped my sister raise him for the first few months of his life It s hits me soo hard every single year It never gets easy Usually around this fine I have mt bestest friend that I ve known since I was 18 would be here to talk with me and keep mt head sane Sadly it s been 2 year on the 20th that I also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away Last year I ended up coming off the deep end being the first year I didn t have her to be the ground I needed This year doesn t feel much different All I want to do is see his face again and hear her voice I don t want to break down I don t want this year to be like every other year but I already haven t slept in days All I can think about is all the people I ve lost and how I need them now more than ever I just want them back ,0
 I never start a project or a hobby and stuck with it I always get bored so quickly I don t know if it s because of depression I have no friends and I don t want to have friends I try to distance myself from everyone I don t feel like I belong never had a bf i feel attracted but I never want to start anything so I don t make an effort the only people I talk to is my family we are pretty close i started working after graduating but was never satisfied so I got fired twice when I was working I was underpaid and overworked and I felt used because I have no connections nepotism is a big thing in my country I had suicidal thoughts all the time I even mark down a day and how I will do it and before I built up my courage I was fired it made me less suicidal but I have dark thoughts no one understand me it feels like I was never meant to be born that god forgot about me everyone s life seems to be falling into the right plan but why mine looks like it should ve ended long time ago ,0
Hospitals aren t helpful anymoreI actually have people who care about me but that only makes this harder They say it s a selfish act But I m tired guys I m recovering from a stroke and have bipolar and my emotions are often off or going to the wrong person or item I ve been very open about how suicidal I am but a friend asked me to wait until tomorrow to go to an ER because they supposedly have the solution So I can humor them Hospitals no longer help me They just isolate me from my friends and family which is what I need Just keep me away from the sharp stuff and meds But no They take everything and isolate you Usually in an ER first for 12 hours Anyway just need to get through tomorrow then admit myself ,0
Last week after so long of being alone i finally met someone who was awesome and interested in me we would text for hours everyday and then we went on a date and that was great there was so much laughing and smiling In our texts it seemed like she was giving off it s ok to be cuddly with me vibes I thought since our texts explored that kind of stuff I tried to be romantic and hold her hand and etc we went to the movies and I guess I talked a good amount throughout the film and she was probably annoyed I pushed her away and after the date I was blocked it s not damn fair because I felt so close to being with someone who actually cared It s been so long since I was with a girl that gave me so much loving energy She was so beautiful but here I am one week later back to the same boring lonely life ,0
I feel like it would be gray and there would be empty lakes that arise and grow by people crying into it,0
 I dont know where to start I dont want to continue living it seems a sick thought but it is not at least for me and nothing fills me enough to suffocate this feeling which I have had for a while the only thing that dissuades me a little It s videogames and hanging out with my friends which I don t do much even though they re my brothers but when no one is around I just think about dying I have never lacked anything I havent gone through any traumatic situation or I have depression or anything I have no reason why I could explain to someone why I want to die My will to live simply has vanished If I could change my life for that of someone who really feels that he wants and wants to live but cannot for any other cause much more serious and understandable than mine I would do it without thinking about it that way I would have a valid excuse I don t believe or hope that anyone will ever understand my thoughts and the emptiness I feel being alive but it is something I have already accepted ,0
why not at this point honestlyi have 4 attempts under my belt already and kind of just want something to go right this next time td lr reasons are that i ve been molested by my dad for about 8 years now and i went to the police and they didn t believe me because i didn t have any proof i now owe him for all the trouble i ve caused him making him momentarily look bad he s all about appearances touching and shit is still happening and the other day i got choked as a warning for flinching when he touched me so what the fuck is the point in still being alive what did i do to deserve all this i have people tell me it gets better but i still have to wait another year to legally move out as it s illegal to run away in my state and i can t take it anymore ,0
I recently discovered I m bisexual I always knew I just decided to finally acknowledge it I ve gone a few dates with both men and women and nothing pass that I get like 1 2 dates at the most and then nothing after that It never works out I feel like the cards are always stacked against me They never have time or they have to move away or they just want sex or they go back to their ex I mean it s always something Im sick of it I m tired of talking and constantly starting over I let myself believe for just a second that somebody is for me and it could work out this time but every single time It fails I m tired of this I m tired of trying I m tires of crying I want to be in a monogamous loving relationship with somebody who loves me as much as I love them Dear God do you hate me Am I a vile disgusting sack of shit unworthy of love This hurts for real ,0
We ve been dating for a while and he s been depressed for most of it unfortunately it s become much worse recently and nothing seems to help He s also become just the most inconsiderate person to be around since the beginning of the relationship He s in a state where anything I say determines what he ll do If we were in a normal relationship we d just break up no problem but this has gotten so out of hand I don t know what to do Help I m bad at writing so apologies if this doesn t make sense thank you ,0
 Question I am not suicidal however i dont mind dying I feel that life just goes on nothing really interesting matters and if i were to die tomorrow it wouldnt really matter Is this normal It is an easy method for me to cope with stress or tackling failure if it happens i could always just off myself I dont know if this is healthy sorry if this isnt the right place to ask ,0

So many events in the past that should have no long lasting effect on me always pop out from nowhere Just past traumas like screwing up my first semester for college or leaving some very close friends by resigning from a job to improve my grades in college It hurts so bad and recently it has been worse than usual I m really considering getting a prescription for antidepressants but I ve heard that withdrawals are like 5x worse than the lowest low I m taking psychology in college so I feel like I should have better control over my emotions but I m almost at my breaking point right now I m in this depressive state where I just don t know what I m doing with my life and I have a need to compare myself to others worse off in some way just to make myself feel better which is an asshole thing to do but it s hard to help it sometimes What re some coping strategies that I could use to not feel like piss every moment I m awake ,0
Just as title says ,0

The scheduling activities going outside etc sounds behavioural activation which is used in cognitive behavioural theory What kind of therapy does your therapist provide I do CBT and a session is normally talking about the various exercises I did since the last session what did didn t work and then getting new exercises and setting goals to be reached by the next session It s not at all what people would imagine if they think of therapy as shown in the media comfy chair just talking about problems etc ,0
I can t do this I can t frigging do this it s too much it s all too much last night I was woken by the most horrific stomach chest pain it was like I was being crushed and I could barely breathe Took nearly an hour to pass and then I couldn t get back to sleep and when I did just awful nightmares and hearing noises in my head I m freaking terrified all the time this is killing me maybe I m just gonna beat it to it take back control once and for all ,0

It s been 1 year 7 months and 27 days Since my best friend was found dead of a planned overdose in his home I have a folder on my desktop with pictures of him videos he made drawings he drew and his suicide note he left Today was the first time I looked at any of that stuff since he died I cried for him for the empty hole left in my heart from my loss I dream about him I did just last night It helps me remember the way it felt when he d hug me and hold me close Time keeps moving forward I still blame myself but it doesn t eat away at me until I m sleeping When it comes to suicide it s not a one and done action at least not for the loved ones I hope everyone else is coping okay today ,0
If I tell my parents that I am feeling sad they might just brush it off and say Oh I m sorry But if I tell them that on a scale from 10 to 10 with 10 being suicidal and 10 being my happiest day ever I am at a 2 today they have a better context for how I am feeling Just thought I would pass it along ,0
I Survived but after several tries i came the closest that i ever did I OD on a shit load of pills and was dead by the time i made it to the ER I was revived and placed in a coma and woke about 5 days later I am mixed about making it I find that it is still a battle day to day sometimes I am happy I made sometimes not so much However there is one thing I feel like i have fundamentally changed It is really hard to explain but its like a part of me didn t come back But rather is just sitting there dead My feelings all seem very superficial I can laugh smile cry yell but nothing seems to truly move me I am hoping that maybe there is someone else out there that has gone through this or can help thanks,0

Is there a point to living What if you can t work or go to school what exactly is the point of being alive Without those it seems you can t live a normal life No I m not going to work for minumum wage I can t even relate to people cause they all are consumed by their job What if you don t want to work for the rest of your life I really see no point in staying alive I think the small amount of people who care about me will understand as well People thought I needed Zoloft at a young age and all that did was permanently ruin me I was a test rat for the many anti depressent meds I get literally every side effect for every drug what the fuck is the point of a drug when it gives you another problem you will have to take another drug for ,0

Hi Im really not feeling well Wish someone would have gave a fuck for me Tho its just too late for recieving that I can t even breath well This is only poisonous I can t forgive humanity For all it does every moment for all the imperfections it has and for how it just hurt me like this for my imperfections Why did i have to be so unfortunate The only things that make me feel anything near alive is achieving things and accomplishing tasks But ive been failing at that recently Ive been feeling so f retarded for failing I can t ever accept being vulnerable I have been hurt so much A sweet pleasant death would be amazing I have came into this point that i see everyone as potential enemies and i see every weakness as potential game changer And i can t forgive myself if i fail like this so often I can t forgive myself I cant forgive others I have to be strong I can t let any bad chances exist These repeat in my head I can t stop it Wish me death ,0
I Try Very HardTo make sure that I do not do or say things to hurt people Even when I know they are in the wrong I try so incredibly hard to be a good person Occasionally I get recognized for it Sometimes I m truly happy But most of the time I m sad underneath the cheerful facade I put up Lately more than ever it s hard to keep pretending that everything is okay I try so hard to keep my family together To pay my bills To be a good person To be a good friend I m so tired At this point I feel very strongly that the only reason I m still alive is that if I committed suicide it would just cause unnecessary harm to those who love me Lately I find that I m beginning to care less and less I just want to sleep ,0

ive been fantasising about my own suicide for a while now maybe 2 years i m 15 they used to be more like an idea in my head like in some weird dream world or in a fictional place or something and the end felt figurative and it was just like falling asleep peacefully and never waking up these days they re getting more and more realistic like in my bedroom with a bottle of pills i know where to get or carbon dioxide poisoning with the burner in the kitchen cupboard the pain with ending my life is becoming more and more real and it keeps appearing in my dreams too i have never meant to act on the fantasies but last night i felt really impulsive and something my friend said deeply disturbed me and i had a really strong urge to harm myself or run away from home or take a bunch of pills any pills i think i had a panic attack and i calmed myself down by cutting but it was scary how strong the urges were sorry just wanted to rant lifes being a bit rough ,0

I can t even cry anymore I feel utterly worthless I don t have an appetite anymore all I can ever do is sleep and I can t bring myself to do the things I usually enjoy I might as well have the help hotline on speed dial how much I call The world is better off without me and I without it I m constantly crying out for help to no avail Why do I even try anymore I can t think of a good suicide method though ,0
I m 21m and I would think it s depression or anxiety and I feel stupid cause I m not the brightest guy around it feels as though I m judged I d self medicate wit alcohol or weed which would give more anxiety but my doctor gave me lexapro I don t think it works idk it doesn t help cause I m alone and it doesn t matter if I m having a good time it only matters when it ends cause I have nothing that s interesting which is being alone and thinking about dying is scary and unavoidable so being alive is scary but I want to be better so what if I don t have the option too be better Edit I was already thinking I d get no replies but I got dm from someone trying too promote me drugs for my problems so that s all I get ok smh ,0
i know this feeling like the back of my hand a month before my 21st birthday i finally said fuck it and tried it do i personally regret it no but do i think about it every day thereafter a hundred thousand percent just three days of heaven ripped away from me because i couldn t stop myself from trying to share with my partner to which he freaked the fuck out ig rightfully so and we planned to move literally across the country before my birthday so now i have zero connects but i cant stop thinking about it and i dont think i ever will ,0
I don t know what to do anymore I m scared of everything that s been going on My parents are physically verbally emotionally abusive My best friend at school hasn t spoken to me in weeks and I think it s because she doesn t want to deal with my suicidal tendencies and my selfharm The boy I fell in love with told all his friends about my depression and now they all shower me with fake sympathy and laugh at me behind my back My school headmaster forced me to take a medical leave for the rest of the school year and I m scared that I won t get into college because of this Worse yet the people at school made up a whole story of lies meant to hurt me and get me expelled I don t want to live anymore I ve dealt with enough beatings enough betrayals enough horrible words from the person I blindly loved enough unwarranted hatred from every single person around me I don t know what to do ,0

When seeking help ends in a suicideI tried to seek help and instead I am stuck with a lifelong badge of unemployment basically So I will check out Fuck being honest and seeking for help And fuck everyone who says this Fuck you all of you who say that you want to help people i e psychiatric doctors but instead of helping people you fuck up their futures I honestly hate all doctors and as long as I live I will never trust another one again I hope that I will succeed in my attempt this time ,0

I am a trans woman but I want to be a cis woman Even the painful stuff like periods I want it all so bad and not being able to have it has meant that I have never been happy And I never will At the same time I feel such a pressure because trans people are meant to have discovered themselves and be happy as themselves now But I have never been happy because that has always been impossible until I am a cisgender woman But that s impossible too ,0

ok so this is my first time posting or whatever so please be nice anyways I feel like I don t belong here and it s too much for me and I wish I was happy like I used too I live with an older person who isn t doing so well and I have so much pressure on me to make sure they re fine and everyday it s something it makes my anxiety so bad then going to college and figuring that out I don t understand how everyone makes it look so easy I try to make myself feel better by thinking everything happens for a reason and maybe that s why I m here but now I m at the point where I don t care everyday I m anxious and my family situation is toxic and I don t know I m tired of being tired I don t even want to do anything anymore and I can t burden the people I love with my problems I have an amazing boyfriend but he doesn t deserve to have to deal with me anymore ,0

I ve been struggling to get out of bed during my days off and I m looking for something that ll get me up and about I was a very creative person but since being diagnosed with depression I ve lost all the creativity I had I ve tried so many hobbies crochet knitting cross stitch jigsaws embroidery jewellery making painting drawing diamond dot art baking etc Ideally I d like a cheap hobby that requires little setup and preferably nothing outside I know this is quite specific Also I m a 21 year old student who is currently at home for the summer holiday so nothing that will take over my parent s house Thank you ,0
How do you all deal with the lack of motivation and perspective of the future I basically keep overthinking how it is not worth it and all and how my current life is not how I want to live in the future However I have to push through the next five years or so if I ever want to live free but I m so tired of it I hope this even makes sense What thoughts keep you going and working on your future Any tips Thanks in advance ,0

Its very tough to die I am afraid of the pain If You going to hang yourself And once you put the rope to your neck there is no coming back Yes it will hurt me the physical pain I would want to undo that and i will regret my decision Because the physical pain and love of life is more more powerful But once its wraped around neck then its over How great would it be just not to be exist Pain is what i have got in my life till now And i am damn sure It is what i am going to gey in the future too then why not end this right now Why its very tough to kill yourself The worry of what people will say to my mom or the worry that my mom dont even know how to use ATM machine Worries me I wish i dont had to worry about that i couldnt even die in peace Will have to suck this up and exist ,0

It s like my anxiety becomes too much and too overwhelming and too draining which leads to depression and just the lack of energy to be anxious anymore It s a weird constant cycle where I m either having extreme anxiety or dealing with extreme depression No matter what I do I can never win something always feels wrong and it s exhausting One of my major ways of coping is through drawing and animating but most of the time I don t even have enough motivation for that these days I don t even know where I m going with this to be honest but everything just seems hopeless ,0
Need some encouragementHello life lost meaning to me since I can remember and I usually keep some checklist around to keep me out of suicide but they aren t enough these days I m sorry about the inconvenience but I would really appreciate some encouragement I don t know if this subreddit is for this but I m feeling awful and don t know what else to do ,0
I inch closer every single day to ending my life I hate the thoughts I get in my head I ve proved that I am an awful person and my past haunts me I m so sorry for those I ve hurt in the past no amount of forgiveness will ever excuse my terrible actions and that s why I feel like there s only one way out One way to make things right I can t live with what I ve done and I can t take it back Whenever I try to move forward and leave my past behind I can t it stops me in my tracks and reminds me that I m still a bad person To my family friends and loved ones I m sorry for the scum that I ve become I m just sorry in general I CANT change I ve tried I have to kill myself I think it s probably the only way ,0
Hopefully I don t wake up tomorrow,0
My best friend stopped talking to me 2 days back It s been so lonely I am having lucid dreams of him coming back I am talking to an imaginary version of him in my head Coz no one else understood me but him Today my parents decided to stop talking or spending time with me We have a duplex I am supposed to stay in the upper flat They do give me food water and everything But it s so painful I am dying inside My whole body is aching and I am feeling sick I can t sleep well I wish everything would just stop I have already had 3 times I tried to kill myself Walked back at the last second 2 times Idk when I will pull thru with it ,0
I dont have any serious problems I have my family I have friends Im not poor or disabled and I have a good life but I just think death may be way better than life Just an empty void where you can t feel or think anything No pain no sadness no thoughts It just seems perfect And life seems so long and boring I dont want to end my pain because I have none I just want to die Im sorry for my bad english Im spanish,0

I need helpI have a letter lying in my kitchen just now If it says that things are fixable then things might be fine If it says that I m going to lose my apartment then I ll have no choice but to kill myself Although I ve been suicidal for years now I ve never seriously considered doing it and honestly I don t want to but I won t have a choice if this letter is bad I don t really know what I m looking for from posting this Maybe reassurance maybe not i don t know ,0

 Love is the only hopeSo I came to the realization that the idea of love is something that keeps us alive I went online to this old profile I had on OkCupid and someone sent me a message It was like I met my mirror image someone who understands everything that I think and feel it s strange because I allowed myself to fantasize about this spark Of course I came back down to reality Relationships are not perfect they re messy and most often than not painful But for a day I let myself dream of what lofe would be like with someone who has no expectations and who loves you unconditionally Essentially by allowing the thought of love come into my mind hope shortly followed suit Hope is all we have in the end ,0
Why can t I just do it Why is there so much hesitation when I finally am ready and then I stop myself The thought eats away at my mind constantly I am so tired and ready to be done but when barrel touches my temple I can t will myself to pull the trigger enough The one time I was drunk enough and ready to my friend had to come over and outside at that moment and stop me I am tired of the day to day monotony of life and sick of being forced to live a life I never asked for I feel like the passenger in a vehicle that I wasn t ready to get in and the drive jumped out So why can t I finally do it What the fuck is stopping me ,0

Suicide spotThe place I plan to kill myself is now populated with spandex wearing cunts since coronavirus every surpressed superhero is now running about in their stupid outfits some of them choose 2 wheels as there method of transport Either way the place I want to kill myself has been spoiled because there is people who usually wouldn t be there and they have now taken over when it should be quite and empty This has really ruined tonight s suicide ,0

it s frustrating I think some of us are just not meant to make it it s as simple as that I won t and i know it some of us don t end up happy don t get a happy ending just an ending which we have to make it s hard and it s shitty but this is it I m just done ,0
This is not for me but my lady s ex he has mentioned suicidal thoughts in the past and that his depression is causing him to leave my lady s room at her parents into an inhospitable state he lives at her parents house He himself has refused to seek help I have some questions regarding the hotline How will they reach out to him Do they track who calls My lady also has depression but it hasn t flared I don t want to be blacklisted in case they find nothing wrong with him and she needs me to call What steps will they take if they determine he does have depression I don t want it to affect his everyday life and his work because he doesn t really have anywhere to go I can understand that this can be perceived as a sort of revenge or prank at him especially since he is my lady s ex but I do have a soft spot for those with depression because I had a hard time overcoming it when it was big for me and now that there are actually resources I d like to reach out so he can get the help that I never got ,0

I can t be alone for more than 2 minutes without thinking about itIf you re reading this is id like to thank you for trying to help others Anyways on to what the title says I can t be left alone with just my thought s for more than 2 munites before I consider doing it I find myself playing video games or watching youtube videos just for the sake of it and not because I enjoy them but so I don t have to be alone with just me Sure I get a laugh out of jokes at work and whilst playing with my friends but I still find myself at times pondering why not Would anyone truly miss me Is this normal common I would atleast like a second opinion and it s not like I m on the edge of doing it but these thought get stronger and stronger every time PS I m 17 years old I work at a grocery store and I m in school for carpeting if this helps in any way ,0
Im outEnding it all tonight Gee motherfucking gee,0
If I end up lying down in my bed for the majority of the day sometimes I think about how small I am compared to space There are billions and billions of galaxies There are a whole heck of a lot of stars in space out there too Compared to me space is too large So who cares about a tiny human like me I ve got a finite number of years to spend yet I m spending every waking moment not having enough energy to move Strangely enough the thought of things that matter much more than my life motivates me to move and do things sometimes Nothing really matters so why shouldn t I get up for once ,0
Yes this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion I have been on both sides of this coin As a helper I find that I didn t really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging Posting a few replies on the person s thread and boosting them up is fine but you it s just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person s friend advisor As a helpee I ve found myself disappointed as the person understandably just seemed like they didn t actually care all that much with their proposal and even if they did it s just not what I was seeking which is not their fault obviously So yeah in a way it might even worsen things sometimes I m all for support but I think that it s actually best to just keep it on the thread ,0
how can I help a friend I dont know how to help a friend I met recently online she has some suicidal thoughts and self harm issues and I want to help her with it she struggles with some similar issues with depression and anxiety as I do though I never had sucidal thoughts or did self harm and I dont know how to help her and its making me realy sad specialy since everyday at evening she seens to get on bad mood and wants to get isolated so I worry for her very much at that time she hasent told me directly that she has these problems I saw her posts on reddit about it when I was looking for the post she made about making friends and how we met and how to aproach this can anyone give me some advice I looked some stuff here on the site and asked some other friends about it but I dont realy know how to help so maybe someone with more experience can help me with that sorry for english and if it sounds confusing its so hard to write this for me Im very confused about it and I just want to help but I dont know how ,0
Honestly I ve never been happy Even looking back as a kid I was being so abused that I was just numb I wasn t even happy as a child and that s something that will forever sting My body is falling apart and I m not even in my 20 s yet I wish I could live without all of this chronic fucking pain I will forever have to live with the fact that I can never completely heal my body or mind I ve been to therapists I ve been to doctors but none of them have been of any help They ve all told me that this is something I just have to deal with I m completely and utterly hopeless at this point This isn t a life I want to live I don t even have any friends and my family hates me I really don t see why I should stay alive at this point I just wish my brain didn t have a literal chemical imbalance Fuck ,0

Everyone I love is gone stuck in a bullshit job Nothing that I really want to do with my life I ve always been a giver and love to take care of others but there s no one left to need me Bills and life are so expensive and once I pay them I just have to pay them all over again I can buy a handgun or a shotgun and just have it all be over but I can t decide ,0

TodayI spent a good part of this afternoon walking around my neighborhood in a kind of daze Walking without purpose I ended up in the local park I sat on a bench there for an hour not doing anything Just sitting Then got up and walked slowly home I live in a big city but I don t remember seeing another person the entire time It was so lonely I wish I could preview my world after my death like it s a beautiful life I think I d be a lot less resistant to dying if I knew my family would be okay Oh well Maybe I ll go back to the bench tomorrow ,0
ExpectationsI m really just so so tired I ve been various degrees of suicidal since my mid teens and it s almost always over people s expectations of me There has never ever been any allowance or understanding of my mental state If I m not doing perfectly in life then I m to be guilted insulted made to feel like dirt I ve been at breaking point for years but my performance hasn t been allowed to slip I kept writing essays and putting together presentations even when I hadn t seen other humans or the outside world for weeks and once three straight months when I couldn t sleep over debt when I was awake 5 times every night convinced someone was breaking in when I was distracted trying to catch ghosts on my camera when I was sane but breaking down from stress every night Now in my last year of university I have given up I couldn t work 30 hours a week and study 50 hours a week and somehow it led to uni being the one that I dropped When she finds out I don t know what my future will hold but it won t be good ,0
Am I supposed to feel bad that my mom is a prostitute I found out a few years ago she s obviously never told me but if she is trying to hide it from me she s doing a horrible job at it You can see my post history for some of my other bullshit but I honestly don t know if I should be hurt by this I m confused and it only adds even more to the fucking misery Fuck ,0
Hi Every since covid hit I have been struggling with being sad all the time and depressed I was 13 when it started and have not been the same since The problem is usually the reason I m sad is because I m super insecure of my weight how I look I also never go out with people I used to because I break down because I hate how I look Everytime this happens or im depressed for a few days I eat way to much it s basically a viscous cycle that happens all the time pretty much some days are better then others but always bad I was wondering if anyone have any suggestions on how to stop eating a lot or how to loose weight or even have to love myself what ever works If anyone else has struggled with this and has found a way to cope that would be great to know some tips ,0

Suicide what s it like Has anyone here actually survived a suicide attempt What was it like I ask because I m kinda flip flopping on it right now I don t wanna die but I just think we re all just too fucked to get any kind of positive ending Maybe the express lane is the best way out The express lane being suicide in this case ,0
The only exception is whenever I m around pets otherwise when someone in my discord server posts some hilarious meme or joke I never come along with it and just stare desensitized and I get mad like what s wrong with me Whenever I m in public I ll usually fake laugh so I don t come off to anyone as rude or ignorant I ve never been diagnosed for depression but I have however been diagnosed with social anxiety and ptsd and I plan to be with my psychiatrist for more visits later this year I just want answers I hate feeling this way ,0
So suicide has become one option against constant pain But am I the only one who is so torn between these options If I choose to live it ll be constant fight mental and physical pain and no guarantees that it would ever get even on the good side The other path is peaceful and demands nothing But tomorrow I have to know which one to choose because I will not live my final moments struggling I will sell whatever I have eat whatever I want to etc The other path demands military like discipline for years to even get even ,0

Sometimes I do sometimes I don t I could never stay away from my mom even for a little bit as a kid and a teenager I loved my mom like most people do but it was perhaps almost unhealthy for me because I never ever wanted to leave her side Now it feels weird sad and yet amazing that I am living without her and it has been 3 years already I felt better for a while had given up frequenting this sub for a couple of years and now I am back here I just can relate with a lot of people here ,0

Hello My 32F boyfriend 33M has been depressed for a long time and he quit his meds recently because it numbed him a lot and he seemed to be doing better the past 6 months However he seems to be sinking again He complains that he has nothing to do but also he doesn t feel like doing stuff either I tried suggesting things to do I tried doing things with him too I also tried just being supportive and hugging it out I don t want to baby him or manage him but I want him to be happy and fulfilled I would like to know if any of you have some suggestions that could get him out of this rut so that he could start enjoying things again Thank you ,0
Felt happy todayI was at work and felt a tight chest pain I thought I was having a heart attack It made me so happy I smiled genuinely for the first time in I don t know how long I was so disappointed when it was only heart burn I even tried some jumping jacks Wish I was strong enough to just eat my gun but I m scared of being a vegetable I have a failed attempt under my belt and it scares the shit out of me to not succeed Thank you for you time ,0
I ve never been depressed really I ve always lived my life carefree without much thought But for the past year I ve gotten thoughts of suicide Mainly because my life is so fucking bland and boring The most exiting thing that happens in my life is playing video games my life is really dumb tbh If I wasn t a minor I would have already killed myself because I want to shoot myself rather then hanging or any other method The quickest way Plus I don t have any thing to hang myself with So I most likely won t kill myself until I can get a gun Probably 18 Has anyone else felt like there life doesn t mean munch like this When I think about my future I know I will just work some crappy job because I can t go to college Thinking about what my future holds is what really makes me want to kill myself This compared to the other stories on here might sound dumb but idk if I had a gun I d already be dead tbh There s more then this but it s pretty boring and I mm kinda lazy so eh,0

I feel like i m just living because of other people not because I have a will to live The thought of killing myself gives me peace All I want to do is end my life but I can t do that because I love my parents and family and killing myself is so selfish I feel like the only reason I haven t killed myslef is because I don t want to hurt the people that care about me But I feel so unhappy and like my life is going nowhere cause I d love most of all to be dead I feel numb and every meaningless task just adds to the dull lie that I live with everyday My life has no meaning I don t want to live but I can t end it cause I don t want to hurt my family I feel like I m in an empathetic paradox ,0

Part of healing trauma is acknowledging your role as an active participator in its creation You cant change the world you can only change how you see it Sounds like you have some inner work to do as you are seeing your world around you as self existent Try to meditate Try to let go of the narrative that is dominating your consciousness ,0

It sometimes feels like we re not the broken ones to realize that the system is making people hurt Others live this life like they re a zombie 9 to 6 smoke drink forget 9 to 6 again They must be the broken ones to not realize how much potential they have and how they re wasting it making someone else a fortune ,0
Why am I Writing This Let me be absolutely clear I know this will devastate my family I know this will devastate my friends and I know this will devastate my community Let me also be clear in saying that depression has made me look at all those horrific consequences and realize I simply do not have the willpower to live my life solely for the benefit of others Tomorrow I am going to drown myself in a lake It will be cold and painful and perfect a quiet end to a quiet life Perhaps if I lived longer I would find something to live for perhaps I would make something of myself perhaps none of that would happen and a year down the line I kill myself anyway having let the cruelty of hope drag me down into another painful year I know that all my problems lie intrinsically within myself and I simply cannot bear it any longer It s sad that at only seventeen years old I m going to hurt my family in ways even the most vengeful person couldn t dream of but this has to be done I am sad and tired Goodbye ,0

GIVE ME A REASON,0
I don t want to die but I don t want to exist There are people around me but I ve never felt more lonely I have a path I need to take but no one to guide me I m lost I m numb I m incomplete unfulfilled and unwanted So what s the point To live and make others happy Or to die and make them upset Either way they ll make it about themselves and judge my actions So really there is no difference no matter which direction I go ,0
I just have a lot of confusion this morning I think that s just apart of depression for some of us It s all relative Life is absurd The choices I make the dreams I have the lack of understanding or clarity I really have no other purpose than to get as healthy as I can in the time I have left I don t have any grand mission in life but if I did would I be better in some way My existence has been painful and I just popped out of nothingness for no reason Is this what managing despair is I think so I think I m just releasing shit in writing so I can forget this shit the way I m feeling the thoughts I m having my confusion I don t think I got enough sleep that s going to fuck me up today I just had a vivid dream woke up with a headache like I often do Fuck I think that one of these antidepressants is giving me headaches or it s caffeine withdrawal ,0
A few moments of happiness are not worth all the suffering in the long run Some days are good overall but most of the time they aren t It is just not worth it to go through all that shit only to get a little bit of happiness if any at all ,0
I can finally kill myself I really dont have any reason to live anymore Nothing I am now all alone Not even my family likes me Im a straight loser I actually look forward to dying i guess Im just an idiot I already wrote my suicide letter And i already have a plan on what to do I think Im finally ready to actually do it Ive hesitated before but I think now is the time Its time for the end ,0
I look like my dad so when my mum sees me she disassociates and starts seizures and screaming because it gives her flashbacks of being abused so I can t comfort her and have to go away,0
StuffStarting to feel like nobody listens or really cares for me That I m just an annoyance That it would be better if I wasn t around Not like I ll succeed in college anyhow or even get accepted tbh ,0
I wish everything was just overHapiness is a lie Winning is impossible Life is just a series of lies failures pain almosts and the only peace you ll find is in death It s a fact and don t you fucking deny it I ve done EVERYTHING I can do to improve myself and my situation without ruining everything else and I can safely say that it doesn t get better It gets even worse and worse People say that it gets better for them not for me Some people have their dreams come true not for me only nightmares I give up ,0
Painless suicide methods I thought mixing a benzo with alcohol but I was told I d go rather than die I also thought of taking many quetiapine pills and than stab myself in the gut to avoid pain Would that work Does anyone know of an effective painless method I need to know My first attempt at suicide was with ghb but it failed miserably I woke up only a few hours later Thanks,0
My life is over why would you do this to meIt hurts too much,0
No although advocating for specific treatments or self help strategies breaks a different rule From the body of the post fundraising awareness raising petitions calls for participation or any post that s mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support ,0
today is the dayI think today will be the day i finally end it I got my rope tied up not sure if its perfect The sun is shining and the air is warm outside I think it is a wonderful day to die There is nothing left to live for anymore Im a hopeless human being and I think I m finally ready to let it all go ,0
Does anyone else have nonstop intrusive thoughts My brain is nothing but suicidal thoughts foggy can t concentrate random mush running in the background I feel extremely numb and depressed all day I told my parents and they are extremely supportive I would never hurt myself but how the hell are you supposed to get through this I just feel so terrible all day and I have these nonstop intrusive urges thoughts of suicide death etc It s almost long random strong urges to hurt myself Seems to be getting worse by the day Is this fairly normal for depression It all feels so bad I always think theres something wrong with my brain My emotions and mood changes 100 times a day WTF ,0
So I m in a very bad place since Idk how much time I don t have much money as I don t even work anymore but I really needed help and wanted to get help so I payed for a private psychologist It s been 10 sessions now and they sended an email to my psychiatrist that I ve got from the public system after trying to die saying that they transfert my case to her It took 10 sessions and 1500 from me for that and all that time that I thought I was getting help wasted This money was precious money give me a lot of anxiety And it s all wasted,0
You ever notice Therapists will see you for 45 mins once a week at most a psychiatrist will maybe see you once a month if you re lucky and the rest of the time Just deal with your own shit Are you miserable Wallowing in your bed all day Too sad to brush your own teeth or hair Crying at the smallest thing Ready to die but not able to muster the effort to plan it Oh f cking well Handle it No one wants you to reach out Mental health professionals just want to help the Karens of the world with their drinking problems so they can take Little Billy to soccer practice without getting a DUI and then all the therapists and psychiatrists can go home to their wonderful well adjusted families and think about what nice people they are because they help people when really they ve helped no one ,0
Don t feel like anything I feel like I m going to just be cast aside and forgotten if I m not already people don t want to have to deal with me which I get it I m an annoying mistake but it still hurts And the one person that could make things better won t even try to be there for me at all and it makes me really sad because I thought I meant enough to them for that everyone I know will tell me things and then just leave me alone and expect me to be able to do them when I m at my lowest I hate being the way that I am and I don t know why I had to be born this way I want to put a bullet in my head so I can stop this constant agony ,0
I just wish I was dead There anyone out there who can help me ,0
I don t want to continueI ve made a lot of bad choices in the past three months that make me want to kill myself I tried last night and couldn t even do that right I just want to die quickly I don t have anything else to live for I can t seem to find anything to live for Not even my mother ,0
I can t sleep no matter how tired I m always taking in everything and coming up with reasons in my head why everyone s plotting to hurt me and betray me and nothing has convinced me otherwise it s the most out of this world things but I m always convinced and feel like my life is already falling apart my friends are leaving my family is disappointed but none of that is happening and the likely hood is so stupidly small but I can t shake the thought they re always there and they re so many different ways I think people want to destroy me from the inside Idk if this is something wrong with me or if I m just pathetic and people usually do the same thing,0
Today after my run I sat near a lake and just started crying and thought to myself I can t go on I have had enough and why and how and should I be saved,0
Just thinking about the word worth the worth I have for myself for others and for this society and system I m completely worthless in all of these listed things ,0
 So I know no one on this sub can help my mental health and that s ok But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I don t want to be alive all that much I m young 17 and my life so far hasn t been as hard as some people s but it s not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit Constant battle with what I m thinking could be adhd ocd anxiety and depression although I m not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too I can t quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be especially going forward I see nothing beginning to help me I ve tried substances and techniques and they don t help Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I don t see any other options Has anyone else felt lost empty and frustrated in this way and gotten better Any success stories about conquering mental health Thanks y all,0

God I feel so shitty constantly Like I haven t been happy in months I tried to share how I was feeling with a couple friends and we aren t friends anymore because I m depressing to be around The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself is I didn t want to fail and end up paralyzed or brain damaged or in a mental hospital Life is just so shit I had to do a gun safety course to be allowed to buy a gun but I finally got in and passed it and now I can buy a shotgun I can t wait to be out of this absolute fucking shithole of a planet The worst part of depression is I know nobody else can help me and I m too far gone to help myself I ve tried what I could I m basically a walking pharmacy I ve been to therapy I ve talked to family Nothing actually helps at all Anyways I guess I just wanted to get that off my chest ,0

Banned from offmychest not even posting there so posting this hereI recently lost someone I cared very much about because of my own mental problems before meeting them almost half a decade ago I was able to just not care about life and kept going on autopilot then I met them and we started dating and suddenly there was someone I could talk to about my own problems and insecurities someone I could talk to whenever I wanted to cry and they d cheer me up of course I did the same for them But my mental problems didn t go away even with treatment and a few days ago I managed to drive this person away in a fight I caused because of my own insecurities now I m alone feeling like death contemplating either disappearing or straight up killing myself thoughts I don t want but won t stop won t go away and I have no one to talk about this I ruined the one good thing I had going for me in my life and I m never gonna get it or anything like it back ever again I m a terrible person who deserves this ,0
Chronic Depression I m at this nihilistic point in a way I m not necessarily apathetic though I just don t feel like I m genuinely interested in living I understand the good and bad those clinical dead patients you hear about how that was the greatest moment clich I want that experience so much My relationship isn t great and I can t even begin to describe what s exactly onmy plate This is kind of how I feel in a point blank sense It s a waste of time to talk to a professional because it s just advice what they could tell me or what anyone could tell me is kind like yeah I know I can feel or understand that advice but I STILL feel this way Nobody on this website can take the amount of time to get emotionally connected I m too much in my head irl to express everything to a counselor I m a pacing quiet numb human I m scared lonely and afraid But eerily at ease and maybe that s the most alarming part Being okay or comfortable in that depressive state ,0
Today is the death anniversary for my nephew We lost him to a tragic drowning accident 9 years ago He was two when he passed away and I was the only one in my family that ever got to meet him and be with him I helped my sister raise him for the first few months of his life It s hits me soo hard every single year It never gets easy Usually around this fine I have mt bestest friend that I ve known since I was 18 would be here to talk with me and keep mt head sane Sadly it s been 2 year on the 20th that I also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away Last year I ended up coming off the deep end being the first year I didn t have her to be the ground I needed This year doesn t feel much different All I want to do is see his face again and hear her voice I don t want to break down I don t want this year to be like every other year but I already haven t slept in days All I can think about is all the people I ve lost and how I need them now more than ever I just want them back ,0
I m feeling completely stuck I have a meeting with work tomorrow to return soon and I m absolutely not ready I can barely wash feed or look after myself properly most days and the only reason I do right now is to look after the family dog I can t afford to be off sick anymore but I m not well at all and work was something that triggered some of this depression burnout and anxiety in the first place even though I ve had it fluctuating for years I m stuck without an anxiety med because the doctors haven t sent it TWICE to the pharmacy Anyone I usually would go to for professional help is on holiday I ve been waiting for an assessment from the community health team for 6 weeks and its been cancelled once and I haven t heard anything since I asked when my assessment would be rescheduled I just feel so useless I ve been barely holding it together and I don t know what on earth I m going to say to my boss and HR tomorrow because I m still a wreck ,0

I just don t know how longer I can do it I used to call myself a survivor But I know I am not one Like who even am I kidding even I know time s running out for me I don t really know how much exactly but there would not be enough time for everything I know that I can cheat Death only for so long before it gets me for good And I ve been doing that my entire life And I just want to rest now One day death would get me by hook or crook one way or another I am still holding on and trying but I can t stop hiding from it forever Its got to stop And I know I am losing this game like always but this time it would be a permanent check mate In this so called game of life this would probably be my last failure I know that just by writing all this makes me so selfish in a lot of ways but I don t know what to do I don t know how to end this post so this also would remain incomplete,0

To if you are still out there Please let me know About a year ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for someone to talk to A user by the name Ryfflex contacted me We talked for a couple of months off and on before my life had gotten too busy and I hadn t had time to check up or get back to you I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account you had mentioned it was a throw away but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still okay I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others now I want to check up on you Hopefully you have made another account and hopefully you are able to see this I just want you to know that I am still here to talk to Let me know how you are buddy Hope to hear from you again soon ,0
 I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot He says he feels the same but he doesn t show it We re both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other 5 or 6 times within 3 months why he takes hours to answer messages while always online why he isn t more involved in the relationship He wasn t like that at the beginning and I m not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not I ve been having difficulties trusting people because of one past relationship and I m not sure I believe him 100 although I really want to I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious How can I support him especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he can t give me the relationship I want He says he can t offer me consistency that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next I have no idea what to do and how to do it ,0

Feeling THAT way Talk to me Hi I m a little frazzled right now so forgive me for any typos or poor grammar I just had the final fight with my girl We were together for over a year then broke up for 8 months after which I gave her a second chance I m the not biological father of an 18 month y o little girl so there s a kid that I m very much in love with that I have no legal standing to ever see again My now ex was so emotionally abusive after two go arounds with her I m just broken I ll probably never get to see my daughter again and I m not seeing much reason to continue What do I do ,0
For months now I ve been pining for the past To go back to simpler happier times and not be a trauma riddled mess Whenever I have to acknowledge that such and such an amount of time has passed it reminds me of opportunities missed and denied friendships lost what could have been and never was And I feel like I ve lost too much precious time to be able to live the life I might have wanted 10 years ago And that it all went wrong somewhere someway and I can t have it all back And that there s nothing to look forward to but endless misery It s funny because when I m thinking clearly I know the past wasn t as rosy as it looks but I don t think it s the past per se that I m clamouring for so much as another opportunity to live my life again without feeling so worn down and broken Well this was a strange introductory post Hi I guess to everyone else here ,0
I keep showing a happy face to everyone but in reality all I want in my life is to not have a life anymore I don t want to kill myself I just want to die somehow painless Does anyone else feels like that too ,0

My MI was getting worse and I lost my job because I had to take too many days off Then I fell into a pit of depression for a month I thought if I found a new job I would feel better I got a job and after a day and a half I had to leave I couldn t do it I was a trembling sweaty mess from anxiety and my concentration was shattered The whole day and a half I was using every trick I know to stay sane and nothing was sticking I was totally overwhelmed Now I don t know what I m going to do I know society at large wants me to contribute to capitalism or die trying But the few people who love me don t deserve to be hurt like that I really want to kill myself and get it over with but I ve tried and it s harder than it looks I don t have a gun But I don t have any other solution either Burden people while living or hurt them by dying This world is a fucked up place ,0

I have recently been struggling so much to make it through every day and I have been relapsing my self harm whilst knowing I have a camping trip to a river coming up soon I feel like an immediate threat to myself and yesterday I almost went through with ending my life I contemplated walking to the active train tracks near my house because it would be a quick and easy death but I didn t end up going because I have ADHD and forgot about the whole thing I always want to die and I hurt myself so much I have been contemplating getting further help admitting myself into a psych ward but I have no idea how to do that and what to tell my parents I want advice about how to do this I feel like it s what s best for me but I don t know if I am even suicidal enough to get admitted or how to tell anyone I feel that if I don t seek help sooner I will not survive much longer I feel like I have a good 4 days before I fully snap and go through with it ,0

Take your meds exercise stay busy This is the only consistent advice I receive I m not really looking for advice I just want to die I thought life was going decently for a little bit I still wanted to die but at least I was being social and having some modicum of fun But recovery is a lot of hard work more than I can bear right now So I ll go back to wallowing in self pity and isolate myself from anyone who could show me fake love I know they don t really care They just don t want my death to inconvenience them Hope some people can relate to wanting to shut themselves off from the world I feel like I ve always been crazy for this ,0
She hit me again In front of the toddler Again Apologized Again Promised not to do it again Again Screamed at me to get out of the room after Again Called her family to happy talk about how great things are Again Locked herself in the bedroom while I bathed the kid and put him to bed by myself Again I could walk away I could grab any one of the kitchen knives and make her clean up what s left of me But that leaves the kid with her Alone I could try to take the kid with me With no money No place to live No car No bank account Just me and a screaming hungry toddler sleeping on rocks until we died of starvation or get raped to death by the cops or eaten by dogs Or found more likely than not Locked up drugged restrained beaten and raped some more brainwashed some more Declared incompetent Put at her complete mercy Get a bill for 30 000 for being locked up Have that hung over my head Getting hit every month is the least harmful option here Fuck ,0

Is it normal to think about ending your life everytime you re sad I started having suicide thoughts about four years ago and I did try to end it a few times After one particularly bad attempt I told myself that I had to carry on and the thoughts stopped I genuinely thought I was over it But during the last two years the desire to end my life came back except that it wasn t random like before I happens when I m really sad It feels like I can t allow myself to be sad anymore I don t know what to do anymore I don t want to live like that I need the pain to stop I wish it wasn t so strong and that death didn t feel like the only way out of my sadness I don t know what to do ,0
I am so so sorry It s so sad ,0
Thank youFirst of all please keep in mind that English isn t my native language so I still may make mistakes For the past few months I think since June I was in a pretty dark place Broke off my meds and harrassed by some people I suffer from depression general anxiety disorder and borderline disorder so you can imagine what it was like Constant moodswings emotions turned up to 200 self harm suicidal thoughts Being harrassed by some asshats didn t help too To be honest I started harming myself because of them I just wanted to die to disappear To stop being a burden But now I m back on track I just took first dose of my medications and I already feel better doesn t matter if it s placebo or not It just means I got my shit together Scars will remain but everything can be fixed I wish you all find your path again I love you all ,0

What do you do when you know you re not enough What do you do when you see that you still can t make it How do you deal with the fact that even when you actually put yourself into something and give it all your time you ll never be good enough How do you fight the urge to just give it all up While knowing that giving up will make you feel like shit and how can I How can I live knowing that even if I like doing something I enjoy it I won t be good at it never And I know that if a really feel in peace doing it then I should just enjoy that but I want to be ACTUALLY GOOD AT IT it s not like I m asking to be the best but dammit I m not even better than myself from 2 years ago And I m doing my physical and mental best How do you go through life knowing that no matter how hard you try you won t be better I try and try and try and I try a little harder cause I tell myself this time I ll make it This is my chance still nothing What do you do when you find yourself there ,0

For some context I ve had a history of being on Antidepressants having taken them alongside Strattera throughout elementary After a long ish time after that I 16 17 at the time had gone to my doctor about struggling with depression and anxiety which was affecting my school performance pretty heavily My primary physician attempted to put me on an increased form of my old meds After a few weeks time I felt mostly the same even on Zoloft I was placed on Duloxetine for a while and I still felt awful no matter what I did My doctor kept telling me to give it time that my irregularity was just making it more difficult but I was just waiting for weeks at a time for the feelings or anything to come back It never did I haven t really been taking anything for a long while now I don t really know what to do or if anything could actually help me ,0

Whenever something bad happens I get suicidal thoughts I can t explain how I feel properly It just happens in seconds like I can be in a good mood and all of a sudden out of nowhere the thought of suicide appears It gets more intense if something bad happens Is this normal I don t have anybody to ask this ,0
I m not safe and I don t careWell fuck whatever remains of my life I am too goddamned depressed and hurting from a combination of my adoptive parents father specifically being infantile jackasses to my lack of any love life whatsoever to I don t even know what That I am just fucking done and refuse to go on like this In two weeks I will hang myself on a nearby bridge and just fucking end it No more pain or misery and hopefully if my plan works the way I think it will then my neck should snap and I quietly pass and fairly quickly as I won t be able to cut myself down at that point so once I jump that s it no turning back not that I plan to anyway Thank you to all who have tried to help me through my shit I don t blame any of you for anything I love you all but I can t take this crap anymore,0
About to be one year since I attempted suicideOn October 6th it ll be one year since I attempted suicide I m still deciding if I wanna celebrate that day or go on as if it s just another normal day but I come here today to tell people life gets better After almost a whole year of intensive counseling 2 appointments a week every week I ve become such a happier person I m not nearly the person I was a year ago the broken depressed teen that wanted to end it all i just want people to know it gets better no matter what you re going through and I figured I d share my success story to those who need a little motivation Don t be afraid to seek help it s the best option life gives you My counselor recently sent me a letter saying congratulations for being counseling free and that she was so proud of the person I ve become and it really made me cry tears of joy seeing someone be so proud of my progress I ll leave you with this life s precious enjoy every second of it ,0
I agree pm me anytime is useless imo if someone was that concerned drop them a message not with a I m here to help message me anytime but ask them what s up people don t want to ask for help especially in cases like this where someone s depression might feel silly even though it s not I m not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it,0
How do you know when it s time to kill yourself How do you know you re ready ,0

I many times over have analyzed all of the reasons I get so angry and jealous of my boyfriends life and I finally figured it out Just as the title mentioned I am the problem I can t accept that my boyfriend has his own life and I can t always be in it There are times we ve both joked about wanting to fuse together but I m sincerely sad that we can t always be together I m not an obsessed girlfriend maybe just jealous because I don t have any friends in this new city either But I love him so much Sometimes so much that I want to leave him because I know that I m the problem in our relationship I give him migraines and he says it isn t me but I know better He s just very careful of my feelings which let s me know he loves me too But I can t tell if we ll spend the rest of our lives together or slowly change until one of us hates each other Though I will not be the one to hate first I truly love him and he has helped me more than my entire family through this pandemic I just hope I get over myself ,0

Hi Im really not feeling well Wish someone would have gave a fuck for me Tho its just too late for recieving that I can t even breath well This is only poisonous I can t forgive humanity For all it does every moment for all the imperfections it has and for how it just hurt me like this for my imperfections Why did i have to be so unfortunate The only things that make me feel anything near alive is achieving things and accomplishing tasks But ive been failing at that recently Ive been feeling so f retarded for failing I can t ever accept being vulnerable I have been hurt so much A sweet pleasant death would be amazing I have came into this point that i see everyone as potential enemies and i see every weakness as potential game changer And i can t forgive myself if i fail like this so often I can t forgive myself I cant forgive others I have to be strong I can t let any bad chances exist These repeat in my head I can t stop it Wish me death ,0

so I started medication about 1 5 months ago and I have noticed my anxiety depression and OCD have been starting to get better but my brain feels so empty without these thoughts and I find myself trying to force myself to be anxious or depressed at times Am I crazy Sometimes I feel like I am not truly Ill and am just doing it for attention because a truly mentally ill person would not want to force these thoughts I don t know I hope I m not the only one who feels like this ,0
i ask myself this question almost every day it s not even that my life has been horrible it s just been so utterly disappointing at every turn i m only 17 but i feel like my life so far has been completely wasted i haven t done anything particularly noteworthy so far and probably never will if i were to disappear tomorrow nobody would really notice outside of my family and my one friend i feel like this whole time i ve been desperately waiting for my life to begin but it never has i ve been in anxiety hell for the past year and a half and i just need some relief i promise im not suicidal so plz dont dm just so you can save me just finally examining these thoughts that have been piling up for a long time ,0
Going on 40It is not better yet just more isolated and feeling more pathetic I make a decent living as I can pay my bills All the hard work doing things right pulling bootstraps is BS it is still the same worse health better finances and ready to say fuck it Starting to think cancer diagnoses in mid life is a relief more than a burden at least for us without families Why am I here why do I wake up wishing I didn t or toss and turn all night not knowing where I screwed up so bad to get me here Younger crowds make mistakes have regrets do things wrong because my life of doing things right is horrible just a empty nothing At worse you end up where I am now a pathetic lonely loser with much regret Can t get much worse ,0
This is the first time I ve posted anything like this I feel like even my private TwitteInstagram has too many people This year in general has been the best year for my mental health until recently I m currently isolating because my housemate has covid and I think it s making my thoughts worse I can t seem to get the energy to do minor tasks anymore when at the start of the year I was jogging working and smashing out my uni work I just keep going back to bed and then if I get out of bed it s to have a cigarette Feeling so lost and struggling to feel genuine in my emotions whether that s in my relationship or around friends I just feel like I m watching the world go by when I used to have so much determination of what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be And I don t really love the person I am anymore or my body image Any little advice on how to start getting motivation self love back or words of encouragement would be really useful x,0

I cant stop overthinking my chances of getting transferred I currently go to a real bad university and I feel like if I didn t get out of it I will loose my mind I was also stabbed in the back by one of the very few friends I have and who I thought is nice I cant talk to anyone anymore and I feel like nobody cares I only vent to my mom who was always supportive of me but I think I got to the point where I should stop like if everyone doesn t want to listen to me why do I make the one person who cares more miserable I just don t know what will happen to me or if I will ever be better at some point because I honestly feel like it won t happen and bad things won t stop happening to me,0
I m pretty sure I have depression and Im too scared to tell anyone but I don t know what I can do by myself to feel better,0

I think I am going to end my life Reddit what keeps you happy xPost from AskReddit I see no meaning or purpose in my life I haven t experienced any real pleasure in ages In fact I do not even know what makes me happy anymore I haven t laughed out loud in years Food doesn t interest me I sometimes yearn to go live in a foreign land but then I think I can t survive there I am 27 and live in a developing country I know I might have a really skewed perception of the world I believe everybody is bad mean dirty and just out to make money I am educated but I think I will not fit into the culture of a developed country even if I immigrate things like table manners parties drinks events are alien to me So the best way out seems to be to get out of the world itself If you guys can tell me what makes you happy what helps you get out of bed every morning maybe it will help You are the only ones I can ask as I rarely interact with any people IRL and I have no facebook or twitter friends ,0
